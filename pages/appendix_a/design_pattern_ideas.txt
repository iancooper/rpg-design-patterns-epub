This appendix is really just a scratch-pad containing some concepts noted during the
game study that could potentially be written up as Design Patterns in the future. They
are listed here for one or more of the following reasons:
  - It is an interesting tidbit of game design, but only a single reference to the concept has been found and we are looking for another instance before we can call it a pattern.
  - I haven’t decided that the pattern is worthy of a write-up on its own, and am hoping to discern some more general pattern that incorporates the concept in the future.
  - I plan to do a write-up, but just haven’t gotten around to doing so yet (possibly because I haven’t figured out anything intelligent to say about it).
  - I’ve already done a write-up on it, but forgot to remove it from this list.

  ; Assist : Multiple characters help out on a roll – [[:game:InSpectres]]’ Teamwork – [[:game:HeroQuest]] “Augmenting.” Most games have this Pattern.
  ; Balancing Loop : A Balancing Loop exists in a contest if some gauge that feeds into
the contest is altered in such a way that the gauge either gains a [[:pattern:Failure Reward]] or
a Success Punishment. If the gauge is conflicted, this simply means that the gauge
is altered in such a way that future contests are more likely to turn out differently
(i.e., more likely to fail if the contest succeeded or more likely to succeed if the
contest failed). [[:game:Capes]] rewards “Story Tokens” to the losers of conflicts. These are
used in future contests to introduce new characters and to buy extra actions during
conflicts, increasing their chances of winning those contests. [[:game:Dogs in the Vineyard]]
inflicts “fallout” when a character
  ; Cascading Gauge : A gauge value has a maximum. If more is added to it, the gauge
“overflows” into another gauge. – [[:game:Fudge]] and [[:game:Shadowrun]] Wound Levels (the
“more detailed method” in section 4.57) – [[:game:HeroQuest]] “Masteries.”
Cause-First Abilities: Ability mechanics are custom designed to generate a desired
output based on what the author feels is “realistic” given the game’s premise -
[[:game:D&D]], [[:game:RIFTS]], [[:game:Warhammer]]. That is, a standard cause/effect relationship is
established, where a given cause produces a given effect. Cause-First Abilities are
in contrast to Effect-First Abilities.
  ; Cause-First Contests : The end results of contests are determined purely by what the
game designer considers to be “realistic” based on the contests’ various
contributing factors without regard to the implications of those effects – D&D,
RIFTS, [[:game:The World of Darkness]].
  ; Confessional Mechanic : InSpectres (Also, check out //Shadows in the Fog//).
  ; Conflicted Resource : can spend up in one fashion and spend down in another.
  ; Damage Resistance : aka Absorption, Toughness – GURPS, Hero System 5th Edition,
[[:game:TORG]] “Toughness,” Werewolf “soaking” damage - as opposed to damage
ablation, per say Hero System? Or deflection per D&D (or both of these per
GURPS)? Using “Damage” in the name makes it too specific to Hit Points, I think.
In any case, all of these examples can probably be adequately covered in my write-up of the [[:pattern:Gauge]] Design Pattern merely as ways in which one gauge can be used to
support or detract from another. So, this pattern will probably be pruned.
  ; Death Spiral : a contest failure result that has the effect of making it more likely that future contests will fail – Shadowrun Wound levels.
  ; Degree of Success Contest : a contest where a graduated scale of success or failure is
generated rather than a simple win/lose result – [[:game:HARP]], HeroQuest, InSpectres,
Marvel Super Heroes, [[:game:Paranoia xp]], [[:game:The Riddle of Steel]], [[:game:Rolemaster]], Shadowrun,
Sorcerer, TORG, The World of Darkness.
  ; Diceless : No fortune-based contests appear anywhere in game -- Amber, [[:game:Nobilis]],
[[:game:Puppetland]].
  ; Dice Pools : Sorcerer, The Riddle of Steel, [[:game:Universalis]], The World of Darkness,
Shadowrun.
  ; Drama-Based Contest : Nobilis on initiative, Puppetland on both Initiative and Conflict
Resolution.
  ; Effect-First Abilities : The in-game effects of abilities are designed to fit the
mechanical output of the contest resolution rules – Hero System 5th Edition powers,
Universalis, Dogs in the Vineyard – any trait-based game. Effect-First Abilities
first establish the desired outcomes, or effects, of an action without regard to their
cause. Once that is determined, an appropriate cause is made up to rationally
explain how that outcome was actually achieved.
  ; Effect-First Contests : The end-results of contests are narrated to fit the mechanical
output of contests. In other words, situation is modified to fit the results of a
contest – [[:game:My Life with Master]], Dogs in the Vineyard, InSpectres (?), [[:game:Ars Magica]]
magic.
  ; Fortune-Based Contest : Sorcerer conflict resolution, My Life with Master conflict
resolution, D&D task resolution, Rolemaster task resolution.
  ; Fortune in the Middle : [[:game:Sorcerer]], My Life with Master.
  ; Fortune at the End : D&D, [[:game:RIFTS]].
  ; Flaws : aka Faults – Fudge, The Riddle of Steel, Nobilis - Restrictions
  ; Free and Clear Initiative : everyone states their actions and can modify them until
everyone is satisfied with their declarations, then initiative is rolled (is this just
“Drama-Based”?) - Sorcerer
  ; Gambled Resource : [[:game:Donjon]] – Wealth, Sorcerer - Humanity (?), HeroQuest –
Advantage Points.
  ; GM-less : Universalis, [[:game:Capes]], Discussed as an alternate, or “advanced”, method of
playing Amber.
  ; Hacking : [[:game:Code of Unaris]].
  ; Hot Potato Initiative : hand off story telling control to another player based on specific
criteria – used in ThemeChaser on the Forge.
  ; Karma-Based Contest : Code of Unaris conflict resolution, Nobilis conflict resolution,
Universalis conflicts between players is a bidding process, [[:game:Call of Cthulhu]].
initiative uses DEX from highest to lowest & roll d100 in case of tie
  ; Logarithmic Scale : Fudge, TORG, Hero System, HeroQuest?.
  ; Margin : The Riddle of Steel, Sorcerer, Shadowrun.
  ; Margin Rollover : Sorcerer, Werewolf: The Apocalypse on Damage for Firearms (pg.
227).
  ; Megalith : Game designed with a core rulebook to be endlessly expanded with
supplements. D&D (d20), Rolemaster, The World of Darkness, TORG.
  ; Monolith : Game designed as single rulebook. Sorcerer, Donjon, My Life with Master.
  ; Narrative Control Contest : a contest where players vie for the right to narrate the
outcome of a conflict - Capes, Code of Unaris, Donjon, InSpectres, Universalis.
  ; Never Ending Story : Any game that does not come to a definite ending point.
  ; Nonlinearity : The game abruptly changes in some fashion – My Life with Master has
formulas that trigger specific events; The Pool has players gamble dice from their
pool so a character can instantly go from being powerful to being powerless.
  ; “One Shot” Game : Great Ork Gods.
  ; Open-Ended Roll : Rolemaster, TORG, The Riddle of Steel, [[:game:Warhammer]] – Damage.
  ; Opposed Rolls : The Riddle of Steel – contested rolls, My Life with Master
  ; Purchased Events : Universalis.
  ; Race : aka Species. Similar to Class and Template patterns: D&D, HeroQuest,
Warhammer, Rolemaster (isn’t this really just a class?).
  ; Recycled Fortune : Use a dice roll in one fashion by looking at it one way, then use it
for another purpose by looking at it in another – [[:game:Elfs]] uses the same roll of a dice
pool to determine Initiative and Conflict Resolution; Sorcerer the same roll of a
dice pool to determine Initiative and offensive side of Conflict Resolution; TORG
uses d20 roll for both success and effect by adding different values. Warhammer –
Attack Roll and Hit Location.
  ; Refresh : A vital game resource is “re-fueled” periodically to ensure smooth game
flow.
  ; Reinforcing Loop : A Reinforcing Loop exists in a contest if some gauge that feeds
into the contest either gains a Success Reward or a Failure Punishment. If the
gauge is conflicted, this simply means that the gauge is altered in such a way that
future contests are more likely to turn out with a similar result (i.e. more likely to
succeed if the contest succeeded or more likely to fail if the contest failed).
  ; Relationship Map : Sorcerer
  ; Resource Refreshing : A resource is periodically “refreshed” by giving it more
resources to allow the game to flow. It acts as a sort of “fuel.” HP in HeroQuest.
  ; Rolled Initiative : Donjon, D&D, Rolemaster, Shadowrun.
Randomized Resource: Rolemaster – resource for setting attributes, Great Ork Gods –
resource for setting attributes, starting Gold Pieces in D&D.
  ; Round Robin Initiative : D&D, HeroQuest.
  ; Shared Gauge : a gauge whose value is shared by all characters – My Life with Master:
Fear and Reason; InSpectres: Library Card Gym Card, Credit Card, Bank;
HeroQuest: Hero Bands.
  ; Shared Power : Donjon, Universalis, InSpectres, Great Ork Gods – the gods
themselves.
  ; Skill Defaults : If a skill is not possessed by a character, then it defaults to another
gauge - GURPS, The Riddle of Steel, Shadowrun.
  ; Skill Grammar : Combine various skills to arrive at a derived skill rank - Ars Magica
spell rank system.
  ; Skill Package : lists of skills rising at similar level – Rolemaster Skill Category Rank,
Hero System 5th Edition – skill levels can apply to groups of skills.
Solitary-Die Rolls: Roll a single die for contests (as opposed to Dice Pools) -- D&D,
Rolemaster, HeroQuest.
  ; Steamroller : a contest success result that has the effect of making it more likely that
future contests will succeed.
  ; Story Reward : a reward going to a player for introducing story elements. Capes
converts “Debt” into “Story Tokens” in conflicts. Some of these story tokens go to
the player who introduced the conflict.
  ; Structured Sessions : Donjon, InSpectres, Paranoia xp.
  ; Tattle : players point out mistakes of other players – Elfs has players tattle on each other
when they don’t properly play their Idioms.
  ; Timer : Gauge value changes based on passage of time – The Riddle of Steel “Blood
Loss,” Rolemaster Bleeding, Nobilis natural healing.
  ; Troupe : Having multiple characters so that you can play in more situations. GM role
rotates from player to player on a story-by-story basis – Ars Magica.
  ; Turnstile : Force players to make an irrevocable decision when designing some game
tool, such as a character. Choosing Race in D&D, Priority Grids in The Riddle of
of Steel and Shadowrun.
  ; Unopposed Rolls : D&D, Warhammer.
  ; Verb/Noun pairs : Ars Magica magic system, GURPS magic system.

for character actions. Note that some the following systems have both Degree of
Success Contests and Win/Lose Contests: Ars Magica, Call of Cthulhu, Dungeons
& Dragons, Elfs, Fudge, Great Ork Gods, GURPS, HARP, HeroQuest, Hero
System 5th Edition, Nobilis, The Pool, RIFTS, TORG, Warhammer.
