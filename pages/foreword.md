I first got to know John Kirk through The Forge, and then giving him some design
commentary for his game Legendary Quest (www.legendaryquest.com). John, well
versed in legend, had put together a lot of research for the game, but the system was
pretty traditional in some ways. But with definite potential. Often times when you try to
give advice to an author like this, they decide that you're an obnoxious poof, and ignore
you completely.

John, on the contrary, took to theory and design ideas like a sponge. A fellow
programmer, and educated as an engineer, John understood implicitly that there are
simply better and worse ways to approach any process. And that you at least had to
know what you were dealing with in detail. So he started really looking around at other
game systems to see what the state of the art was, and just how it was that people
approached different problems. While this benefited his designs somewhat, after a while
John announced to me that what he wanted to do was to write this book. To emulate
what had been done in programming in terms of enumerating the methods which people
use in RPG designs. He wasn't the first to propose doing this, and given the rate at
which his game design tended to advance, I was skeptical that he'd be the one to do it.

But I should have realized, given his background in research and programming, that
John was precisely the man for the job. More than that, he'd cracked the essential
problem in terms of making such a document, how to partition the information such that
it could be presented in a manner that made sense to the reader in terms of how one
method is distinct from another. He had a template to work from, and all he had to do
was to fill in the blanks. That's a lot of blanks (as you'll see), however.

So he gutted it out, and what's here is the product of that effort. At the time of this
writing, the document is in a sort of a "beta" format. He and I have batted it back and
forth a bit, but we’ve realized that it’s now time to get more hands on it. That is, it's
understood that his research couldn't possibly be entirely comprehensive, and that some
reorganization is probably in order. But it's more than just a start, it's got enough meat
on it that much of it will stand as written, and those adjustments to it will be informed
by what is already there.

I think that John is doing a great service to the community by presenting this book in
that, if it is accepted by the community, it will have taken another leap forward in
creating a shared vocabulary for us that, started by Ron Edwards et. Al. at The Forge,
has served to make it possible to have intelligible discussions about these matters. So
take it for what it is, a tremendous effort at organizing the design elements found
present in RPGs. Using these definitions and notations about them, and adding to them,
I think this will be an important tool for the design community going forward. That is, it
will be as good a tool as we all hone it to be.
