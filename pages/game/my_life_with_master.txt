//My Life with Master// was written by Paul Czege and is published by Half Meme Press.
In it, players portray potent but psychologically dependant minions of twisted masters
who send them off to perform any number of inhuman tasks. Not only do the players
design their characters, they also collectively design their master. The more the
minions serve their master’s diabolical interests, the more the minions hate themselves.
Their increasing self-loathing makes them more and more capable of carrying out their
master’s orders, but at the same time strengthens their master’s psychological grip on
their psyches. A minion’s only link to his human roots are his “Connections,” which
are people in town whom the minion cares about and visits on side trips whenever the
master sends him out. The more a minion visits his Connections, the more Love he
accumulates, which helps the minion resist the master’s powerful hold. The goal of the
game is for the minions to finally resist and kill their master.

==== RPG Design Patterns Identified ====
[[:pattern:Attribute]], [[:pattern:Conflicted Gauge]] (“Fear,” “Reason,” “Self Loathing”), [[:pattern:Dice Pool]], [[:pattern:Endgame]],
[[:pattern:Flaw]] (“Less than Human”), [[:pattern:Game Master]], [[:pattern:Gift]] (“More than Human”), [[:pattern:Idiom]] (“Love”),
[[:pattern:Narrative Reward]] (“Intimacy”/“Desperation”/ “Sincerity”), [[:pattern:Negotiated Contest]] (which
is very coarse grained – one roll per scene), [[:pattern:Safety Valve]], [[:pattern:Shared Gauge]] (“Fear” and
“Reason”), [[:pattern:Structured Story]], [[:pattern:Trait]] (More than Human/Less than Human), [[:pattern:Trauma
Gauge]] (“Weariness”)

==== Character Makeup ====
The player characters, or minions, of //My Life with
Master// have three numeric attributes of Self-
Loathing, Weariness, and Love. The evil master
has the single attribute of Fear and the
townspeople collectively have the attribute of
Reason.

Minions also have More than Human and Less
than Human traits. These are characteristics or
abilities that indicate the situations in which the
minion cannot fail or cannot succeed. For
example, if a minion has a More than Human trait
of “Has super strength except when he hasn’t eaten for 24 hours,” then any test of
strength will automatically succeed unless he has fasted for a day. Similarly, if his Less
than Human trait reads “Is clumsy unless pursuing food,” any test of grace or agility
will always fail unless he is searching for a meal.

Finally, minions have Connections, which are relationship traits the character has with
individual townsfolk. The sum of the ranks in these traits gives the minion’s overall
Love value. As minions visit their connections, they gain Love which helps them to
break their master’s psychological hold over them.

==== Conflict System ====
The five attributes of Self-Loathing, Weariness, Love, Fear, and Reason are used in
various combinations to resolve conflicts. For example, to resist the master’s orders,
the minion must roll Love minus Weariness against his master’s roll of Fear plus Self-
Loathing (this is actually the minion’s Self-Loathing as the master only has a Fear
attribute). On the other hand, to carry out some violent order of his master, the minion
must roll Fear plus Self-Loathing against his opponent’s roll of Reason plus Weariness.
The various formulae are hard to remember (as least for me), but they do follow a sort
of horror movie logic if you study them carefully.

To resolve the conflicts, dice pools are used. These are made up mostly of d4s whose
number is determined by the formulae previously mentioned. But, an additional die
may be added through role-play as a form of Narrative Reward. Only one additional die
may be awarded by the Game Master on any conflict. It is earned by role-playing
Intimacy, Desperation, or Sincerity. An extra d4 can be earned through intimacy, which
essentially boils down to sitting down and having a glass of wine or meal with your
opponent, giving gifts, or other similarly endearing actions. A d6 can be earned through
desperation, which involves the character begging or pleading his case with extreme
emotion. A d8 is earned through sincerity, the demonstration of real concern for the
opponent. Concerning sincerity, the game text says, “you’ll know it when you see it.”
The master is incapable of sincerity, so the players can always trump the master in this
regard.

Once the dice pools are gathered, both sides roll the dice and sum the results.
Excluding the narrative reward die, any rolls of 4 count as zero. The higher overall total
wins the entire conflict and gets to narrate the outcome. So, there is only one contest
roll per scene.

The fact that different formulas are used for different kinds of conflicts complicates the
diagrams used to illustrate the conflict resolution system. Ordinarily, we could just
stick a gauge labeled “Pertinent Attribute” into one or two diagrams to simplify things,
because most games use their attributes in a similar fashion throughout. But, //My Life
with Master// does not. So, we actually need five diagrams to illustrate the conflict
resolution system: one for each type of conflict that can arise in the game.

==== Turn Order ====
Given that conflicts are completely resolved through a single roll, there are no rules for
initiative or action order within a scene, nor do there need to be. There is a pre-
determined ordering to the scenes, though (see the Structured Story design pattern),
which dictates when players contribute and the general nature of the scenes.

==== Reward System ====
Whenever a minion makes an overture to a connection, he gains a point of Love,
whether he succeeds in his contest roll or not. If he fails, he also gains a point of Self-Loathing. Self-Loathing is also raised whenever the minion successfully enacts a
violent or villainous act in service to his master. Since Self-Loathing is conflicted, with
higher values making it harder for the minion to resist his master’s orders, the raising of
its value cannot truly be considered a reward. From the perspective of achieving the
endgame, it is actually a punishment.

The only other rewards in the game are the narrative rewards given for role-playing
Intimacy, Desperation, and Sincerity. These final rewards are perhaps the most
important to game play, however, because they represent the only real control a player
has over the success or failure of any given conflict.
