//Sorcerer// is published by Adept Press and was written by Ron Edwards. It is a game
that asks the question, “What will you do to get what you want?” In it, players portray
sorcerers who have the ability to bind powerful demons to their service. Before play
begins, the group must decide what it means to be human. In other words, the gamers
must state the aspects of humanity they want to explore in play. Character actions, then,
are judged against that standard. Actions that support that vision of decency increase
the character’s “Humanity” attribute while actions that defy that definition degrade it.
Alterations to Humanity are not really rewards or punishments, though: Humanity is
conflicted. Sometimes you want a high value and sometimes you want a low value.
Low values allow your character to summon demons easily. High values allow your
character to banish them. In any case, the Humanity attribute plays a decisive role in
the game mechanics, so a character’s behavior has a very real impact on his chances for
success in various circumstances and, therefore, on the
storyline. Needless to say, people whose powers are
derived from enslaving demons have ample
opportunity to act inhumanely, so the game has a built-
in tension between what characters //can// do and what
they are //willing// to do. It is perfectly valid to play a
Sorcerer that rejects demons and their seductive
powers altogether and, instead, play a character with
high moral convictions that battles demons and their
masters instead. The game mechanics are set up to
make both options a viable choice.

==== Character Makeup ====
Characters have four core attributes:
“Stamina,” “Will,” “Lore” and the all-
important Humanity. Stamina deals
with physical actions, Will covers
mental challenges, and Lore describes
the character’s knowledge of sorcery.
These three are set through the
expenditure of a pool of Attribute
Points given to players for this purpose.
The fourth attribute, Humanity, is set
as the maximum of Stamina and Will.
As explained above, Humanity provides a gauge of the character’s self-image, decency,
charity, soul, or whatever aspect of the human state the group wishes to explore.
Although Humanity could be classified as following the Idiom pattern, it really is only a
pseudo-Idiom. It does translate a character’s “morality” into a mechanical effect, but it
doesn’t really encourage players to act morally because, at noted above, the attribute is
conflicted. So, we cannot consider an increase in a character’s Humanity to be a reward
(or a punishment, for that matter). In effect, this removes all system-based motives for
choosing one way or another, so moral choices become true character-defining
decisions.

Part of the essential makeup of a //Sorcerer// character is the demon(s) he has bound to his
service, since that is a sorcerer’s only real source of power. The game is quite flexible
concerning the physical characteristics and abilities of demons. If pressed hard enough,
a sorcerer’s range of powers and potency can rival that of comic book super-heroes.

==== Conflict System ====
Sorcerer uses a dice pool system to resolve conflicts. The size of the dice (number of
sides) is not important as long as all players use the same sized dice. The number of
dice rolled depends on:
  - The attempted action, which determines what character attributes come into
play.
  - Damage sustained, which lowers the size of the dice pool.
  - Temporary modifiers that arise from such things as successes carried over from previous rolls in a sequence of rolls and bonuses for the quality of the player’s narration (see the Reward System section below). Interesting and novel descriptions allow players to really heap on the dice, so with entertaining role-play characters can succeed in situations where they would normally fail.

The dice are always rolled in opposition to some other dice pool, either that of another
character (player or NPC) or a fixed sized pool depending on the situation. The highest
number rolled in either dice pool wins. Note that this is not the //sum// of the dice rolled,
but the actual highest number of any single die. If the highest numbers tie, you go to
the next highest number to determine the winner. The //degree// of success is the number
of dice in the winner’s dice pool that have a value greater than the highest number in the
loser’s dice pool, treating ties as successes. So, if one person rolls a 6, 5, 5, 4, 3, 1
while his opponent roll a 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, the first person wins with three successes. The 6,
5, and 5 are all higher than the highest opponent’s die. If one person rolls a 5, 3, 3, 1, 1
and his opponent rolls a 5, 4, 4, 2, the second person wins with two successes. In this
case, the 5’s tie, so we go to the next highest number. The 4 beats the 3 so the second
person wins. The tied fives count toward the second player’s successes.

==== Turn Order ====
Game flow in a given round starts with players freely
discussing what it is that they want their characters to
do. Actions can be amended until everyone is
satisfied with his declaration. At this point, everyone
performing a “proactive” action rolls his dice pool.
The order of resolution goes from the highest values
rolled to the lowest. So, there is no separate roll to
determine action order. If a character has not yet
acted, he may choose to abort his pending action in
favor of actively defending against another character’s action.

==== Reward System ====
Bonuses are awarded to individual
conflict rolls for colorful
descriptions of character actions.
These rewards are given in the form
of additional dice on the roll, and
can accumulate to quite high
numbers for narratives of unusual
depth and emotion.
At the end of every story, characters
have the opportunity to raise one of
the Stamina, Will, and Lore
attributes. This is done by making a Humanity roll against the score the player wishes
to raise. If the roll succeeds, the attribute value increases by one point. If it fails, the
player may try again on a different attribute. If all three fail, the character gains
nothing.
