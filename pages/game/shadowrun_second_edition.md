*Shadowrun* is published by FASA Corporation. It is set on Earth in the year 2053,
where governments are obsolete and corrupt corporations rule society. Shadowrunners
are hired mercenaries enlisted to perform dangerous, illegal, and ethically dubious acts.
Such people carry advanced weaponry of various sorts for self defense and enhance
their bodies with cybernetic implants. One of the most popular enhancements is the
“cyberdeck,” which enables a person to mentally hook into the world’s computer
network, known as the “Matrix.” Don’t think that *Shadowrun* is a strictly sci-fi game,
though. Magic plays as big a role as technology in shaping the world. In the
*Shadowrun* future, magic unexpectedly returned, allowing the races of elves, dwarfs,
orks, and trolls to arise once again. In addition, shaman, wizards, and other magical
practitioners wield strange and potent powers.

### Character Makeup

In creating a Shadowrun
character, a player must
prioritize various character-
defining categories from
most important to least
important. These categories
are: “Race,” “Magic,”
“Attributes,” “Skills,” and
“Resources.” Based on
these priorities, the player is
either given options or a
quantity of resources from
which to draw in each
category. For example, any
player wanting a non-human
character (such as an elf)
must specify Race as his
highest priority. Players
placing more emphasis on attributes and skills gain a larger share of points to use in
purchasing ranks in these areas. Players can have their characters start out rich or
cybernetically enhanced by placing great importance in Resources.

All characters have the following eight primary attributes: “Body,” “Quickness,”
“Strength,” “Intelligence,” “Willpower,” “Charisma,” “Essence,” and “Reaction.”
Magicians get an additional attribute of “Magic.” Characters also have an “Initiative”
attribute. For most people, this has a fixed value of 1. However, cybernetic implants
can raise this value to some degree.

A player can choose to give his character “Allergies” that make him vulnerable to
certain substances. Accepting these flaws gives the player more points to spend in
attributes, skills, or resources.

If a player is in a hurry, he can base his character on a pre-generated template
(“Archetype”). Further character development will then progress at the player’s
discretion as resources and experience allow.

### Conflict System

*Shadowrun* uses d6 dice pools for contests. The
player rolls a number of dice equal to his character’s
pertinent attribute or skill rank. Each die is compared
to a threshold, which is given by the game rules for
many tasks and is otherwise determined by the game
master. Every die resulting in a value greater than or
equal to the threshold is counted as a success.
Characters need only one success to win. But, the
more successes a player rolls, the more advantageous
the outcome.

In opposed situations, such as combat, both sides roll and the number of successes on
each side are compared. The side with the most successes wins with ties going to the
aggressor. The greater the attacker’s margin of victory, the greater the effect. For
example, the damage level of an inflicted wound increases by 1 for every 2 points of
victory over an opponent.

Thresholds generally lie in the range of 1 to 6. But, higher thresholds are possible for
exceptionally hard tasks. Beating such difficult obstacles requires an open-ended d6
roll. Players re-roll any d6 resulting in a six and the values are summed. Additional 6s
compel further rolls until something other than a 6 is rolled or the threshold has been
overcome.

Players can also draw upon their characters’ “Karma Pool” to improve their odds in
dangerous situations. Players spend Karma Pool points to re-roll dice, avoid disasters,
and increase the chances of succeeding in contests. At the end of every encounter, the
pool refreshes back to its maximum.

### Turn Order

Combat is broken up into discrete rounds,
each of which is segmented into an
indeterminate number of phases. At the
beginning of each round, all players roll a
number of d6s equal to their Initiative
attribute and sum the results. To this is
added the character’s Reaction attribute.
Each round has a number of phases equal
to the highest Initiative total. Play
proceeds in order of highest Initiative total
to lowest. Every time a character acts, his
Initiative total drops by 10. If this leaves
the character with a total Initiative greater
than zero, he gets another action after any
other higher valued Initiative scores are
handled. So, if a character obtained an
Initiative total of 23, he acts on the 23rd, 13th, and 3rd phase of that combat round. The
turn order of characters acting in the same phase is determined by comparing the
combatant’s Reaction attributes. High score wins.

### Reward System

The game master rewards players with experience points (“Karma”). These are given
for mere survival, accomplishing missions, overcoming dangerous obstacles, good role-playing, clever tactics, humor, drama, and other things. Ninety percent of Karma goes
to “Good Karma” while the remaining 10% goes into the character’s Karma Pool.
Good Karma points are used to raise attribute and skill ranks.
