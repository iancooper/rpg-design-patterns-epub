*The Pool* was written by James V. West. As of this writing, the game is freely available
for download at http://www.randomordercreations.com/thepool.html. It is a game that
is a model of brevity. In fact, the entire game text is not much longer than this
description of it. The game has no pre-defined setting and is focused on creating
interesting, well narrated stories.

### Character Makeup

Character generation starts by the player writing up a 50
word story about his character. Fifty words is not much to
work with, so the player must focus on his character’s most
important aspects. These elements are translated into traits.
These traits can be assigned ranks by sacrificing dice out of
the character’s Pool, which starts out containing 15 dice.
Just look at that gauge diagram for Character Makeup. Can
it get much simpler?

### Conflict System

{{ :game:the-pool2.png}}
Conflicts rolls can be called by any player, not just the game master. Conflicts are
resolved by rolling dice pools of d6. The number of dice rolled equals the rank of the
character in any single applicable trait plus 1 to 3 d6 provided by the game master plus
any number of dice (up to 9) from the character’s Pool. Any roll of 1 on any die
indicates the player earns a “monologue of
victory.” The player essentially earns the
right to describe the outcome of the conflict.
This does not equate to “success,” though,
because the player is perfectly free to describe
how his character failed. If no 1s are rolled,
though, all dice used in the conflict that were
drawn from the character’s Pool are
permanently lost. Thus, it is always a gamble
for a player to draw from his character’s Pool.
The result of any conflict roll covers the
broad consequences concerning the player’s intent. That is, it covers much more than
the single swing of a sword. It can cover the success of an entire battle (although the
game is not focused specifically on combat).

### Turn Order

The game foregoes any explicit rules for determining when and how often players
perform actions. The game master assumes that responsibility, although the written
rules only infer this point. In responding to a request for clarification, the game’s
author, James V. West, elucidates: “If a player says he wants a roll, let him.” By
observing the other players’ reactions to the resulting monologue, the game master
assesses if he “should stop him at some point or let him go the whole nine yards.” In
other words, the game master decides whether any given roll applies to a brief sequence
of actions or the slaying of the entire dragon. According to Mr. West, if circumstances
arise where multiple players interact within a scene, the game master should simply
wing it. Like the game *Nobilis*, *The Pool* relies entirely on dramatic impact to decide
the ordering of player actions.

### Reward System

Whenever a player succeeds on a roll, he must choose between narrating the outcome of
the conflict or adding a single die to his character’s Pool. Pool dice can be sacrificed to
raise the character’s rank in his various traits.
