*Capes* was written by Tony Lower-Basch and is published by Muse of Fire Studio.
*Capes* is a super-heroes games with the premise: “Power is fun, but do you deserve it?”
The game encourages players to explore their character’s super-powers. However,
whenever a super-power is used, the character incurs debt that will eventually degrade
his performance. A character can lower this debt by performing acts that prove his
worthiness to possess his powers.

Heroes in *Capes* can literally *do* anything: lift buildings, fly between solar systems, see
with X-ray vision, or anything else their hearts desire. That does not mean that a
superhero can *accomplish* anything, though. The game is designed to allow players
complete freedom in the description of their characters’ actions. Its mechanics only
come into play when opposing sides pit themselves against one another in
accomplishing goals and seizing control of events.

### Character Makeup

{{ :game:capes.png}}
Capes characters are made up of ranked traits. These traits are separated into four
types: “Powers,” “Skills,” “Styles,” and “Attitudes.” Traits that are “Powers” are
exclusively the domain of super-heroes. These include such things as super strength,
the ability to fly, possessing the speed to dodge bullets, etc. “Skills” are abilities that
ordinary people perform, such as “Painting landscapes” or “Programming computers.”
“Attitudes” describes a character’s emotional tendencies, such as “Brooding,”
“Optimistic,” or “I’ll believe it when I
see it.” “Styles” pertain to how a
character approaches a problem, such
as “I always pull it out of the fire” or
“Money is no object.” Characters have
twelve traits chosen by the player in
the categories of “Attitudes,” “Styles,”
and “Powers.” The number of traits in
each category must lie between 3 and
5. Once the traits are chosen, their
ranks are assigned with sequential
numbers (i.e., 1, 2, 3, …). The player
decides which number is associated
with each trait.

Important characters also have
“Drives.” These are separated out into
“Heroic” Drives and “Villainous”
Drives. Needless to say, heroes have Heroic Drives while villains have Villainous
Drives. The Heroic Drives are “Justice,” “Truth,” “Love,” “Hope,” and “Duty.” The
Villainous Drives are “Obsession,” “Pride,” “Power,” “Despair,” and “Fear.” These are
ranked, just like the traits. Some of these drives will be assigned an “Exemplar.” An
Exemplar is a character that embodies a Drive’s concerns. For example, Lois Lane
would be the Exemplar for Superman’s Heroic Love Drive.

### Conflict System

Conflicts are comprised of goals and events in *Capes*. A player may introduce a new
event or goal in place of an action, if desired. A goal is some action a character wants
to accomplish. The conflict resolution rules determine whether the action succeeds or
fails. Events are incidents that are guaranteed to happen sometime in the near future.
But, when first described, the event must leave open the resulting consequences. So,
“the rope snaps” might be the declaration of an event. We *know* the rope is going to
snap as soon as the event is declared, but we don’t know what happens as a result.
Players use the *Capes* conflict resolution rules to fight for the right to narrate what
happens. This can be quite important to the story if, say, your character’s lady love
happens to be dangling over a boiling volcano by a rope. As a player, you will want to
obtain the right to narrate the results of the event so that you can describe your character
saving the day in the nick of time.

{{ :game:capes2.png}}
When a goal or event is declared, a short description of it is placed at the top of a 3x5
index card, which is then placed on the table. Two d6 of different colors are placed on
the card with 1’s showing. Each color represents one side of the conflict. So, each side
has one starting die. Any player can declare an action for any of his characters in
support of either side of a conflict. To do so, though, the character must use a trait
having a rank greater than or equal to the number currently showing on the die he
intends to roll. So, lower
ranked abilities are used more
at the beginning of conflicts
while higher ranked ones are
often saved for later. If a Skill
is used (i.e., a non-super-
power), it cannot be re-used in
the same Scene. Super-
powers can be re-used, but
each usage saddles the
character with a point of Debt.

Instead of rolling, a player can
choose to spend an
“Inspiration.” Inspirations are
resources that are each
individually ranked from 1 to
6. Spending an Inspiration
allows a player to set the
value of the die to the value of the Inspiration without rolling. So, they are highly
desirable. Inspirations are gained at the end of conflict resolutions (as described below)
to be saved for later use.

Unlike most games, a player can choose to roll any die in the conflict, whether it is one
on his character’s side or not. Players can either accept a roll or reject it. If rejected,
the die is restored to its previous value. So, a player will generally accept higher rolls if
he is rolling a die on his side of a conflict and he will generally reject higher rolls if he
is rolling a die on his opponent’s side.

If a die roll is accepted, all other players have the opportunity to “react.” A reaction is
simply an action taken by a character to affect the specific die that was rolled. To be
able to react, though, the character must use a trait having a rank greater than or equal to
the current number on the die. If this is done, the reacting player gets to re-roll the die.
Each player can only react once to a given roll.

A player may “Stake” some of his character’s Debt on a conflict by placing Debt tokens
on the 3x5 card representing the conflict. This is a gamble: the Debt doubles if he loses
the conflict. On the other hand, if he wins, he rids himself of the Debt. The Debt
tokens that were placed on the card are converted into Story Tokens, which are
distributed to the player that introduced the conflict in the first place and to the winner
of the conflict.

If Debt is gambled on a conflict, the gambler can “Split” the dice on the side of the
conflict he is supporting. This gives that side more dice, which gives them a distinct
advantage since the side with the largest total “controls” the conflict at any given time.
Control earns narration rights for each action, but the conflict’s final resolution can only
happen under specific circumstances:
 1.  A player “claims” a side at the beginning of a round (“Page”). This is a declaration that he believes he will control the conflict at the end of the round.
 2.  The player controls the conflict (has the highest total on his dice) at the end of the round.

If these conditions are satisfied, the player wins the conflict and gains the right to
narrate the outcome. As stated before, if the loser staked any Debt on the conflict, he
gets double the amount back. The winner converts
any Debt he staked into Story Tokens and gives
them to the losers.

### Turn Order

At the beginning of each scene, one player is
designated the “Starter.” This player sets up the
scene before play progresses. Once the scene is
described, players take turns going around the
table in a clockwise fashion. At the end of every
scene, the person to the left of the current Starter becomes the new Starter and can set
up whatever scene they like to push the story forward.

### Reward System

*Capes* rewards come in the form of “Story Tokens” and “Inspirations.” Story Tokens
are earned by losing conflicts, so they are a [:pattern:Failure Reward](/pattern/Failure Reward). They can be spent to
introduce characters into scenes (the first is always free) and to buy extra actions during
conflicts.

As stated above, “Inspirations” are a resource that can be spent to set dice to specific
values rather than gamble on rolls. Inspirations are each individually ranked. After a
conflict is resolved, the winner matches the dice used on both sides to generate
“Inspirations.” The winner determines their ranks by pairing up the dice used in the
conflict. The rank of an Inspiration equals the value of one side’s die minus the value
of the opposing side’s die. The side with the larger die gets the Inspiration. So, both
winners and losers can earn Inspirations from a conflict, depending on how the winner
decides to match the dice up. Any dice that are left over because the opposing side has
no die to match it are paired against zero. That is, the Inspirations gained from unpaired
dice have ratings equal to the numbers on the dice.

Debt can also be considered a reward, since staking it on conflicts allows a character to
split dice and more easily win those conflicts. However, if a character accumulates too
much Debt, it starts to hinder his activities. So, Debt is actually a [:pattern:Conflicted Gauge](/pattern/Conflicted Gauge).
