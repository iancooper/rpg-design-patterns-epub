**Call of Cthulhu** is a classic game written by Sandy Peterson and Lynn Wilis and is
published by Chaosium, Inc. It evokes the alien, macabre terror of H. P. Lovecraft, who
is a true giant of the horror genre. Lovecraft’s bizarre genius concocted a diverse
mythology of ancient beings that supposedly traveled to Earth from far off galaxies
where the very laws of physics and geometry differ radically from our own. The
greatest of these colossi ruled the cosmos for billions of years, veritable gods in their
potency and otherworldliness. The mere sight of such a creature can cost a man his
sanity, if not his soul. Their longtime slumber is the only thing keeping these eldritch
monsters from devouring the Earth, and various dark cults throughout the world seek
their waking. Mankind might win
small skirmishes to stave off the
onslaught, but Earth’s eventual pitiable
fall is essentially inevitable.

The game gets its name from one of
Lovecraft’s short stories, The Call of
Cthulhu, which the rulebook includes
to ensure anyone playing the game can
taste what it aims to achieve. To
reproduce the feeling of utter
hopelessness in Lovecraft’s tales, Call
of Cthulhu describes most of the
various aliens in terms that are well
beyond the capabilities of the
beyond the capabilities of the
characters to handle. The weakest of them may be slain with great preparation and
difficulty, but don’t count on it. If you go into a Cthulhu adventure seeking to hunt
down and kill the game’s many-tentacled demons, your characters are going to live
short, chilling lives.

==== Character Makeup ====

{{ :game:call-of-cthulhu2.png}}
Characters (“Investigators”) have 9 attributes
whose values are generated randomly. These
attributes are: “Strength” (STR), “Constitution”
(CON), “Size” (SIZ), “Intelligence” (INT),
“Power” (POW), “Dexterity” (DEX),
“Appearance” (APP), “Education” (EDU), and
“Sanity” (SAN). They also have three major
resource pools from which to draw: Hit Points,
Magic Points, and Sanity Points. These
resources are determined by various formulae
based on the attributes. Each character is
assigned an “Occupation,” such as “Antiquarian,” “Dilettante,” or “Professor.” Each
occupation is associated with a set of skills in which the player distributes a number of
“Skill Points” whose quantity is determined by the character’s Education attribute. The
resulting values essentially set the percentage chance that a character has in succeeding
at each skill.

The “Cthulhu Mythos” skill is special. Gaining
ranks this skill lowers the character’s Sanity
Point maximum. So, the more a character learns
about the true and terrifying nature of the
universe, the less stable he becomes. Sanity
Points may
Points may
vary
anywhere
from zero to
the modified maximum. But if it ever drops to
zero, the character goes completely insane. The
mere sight of a Lovecraftian horror usually costs a
character a portion of his sanity.

==== Conflict System ====

Each skill in Call of Cthulhu has a rank, which sets
the percentage chance of the skill succeeding. To
determine success, d100 is rolled. If the resulting
value is less than or equal to the skill value, the
skill succeeds, although a roll of 00 always fails. If
the conflict involved weapons and combat, a successful roll indicates that damage is
delivered to the target by rolling dice appropriate to the weapon used. If the target has
armor, the damage is reduced by an amount depending on the armor’s type.

To resolve tasks involving attributes
(“Characteristics”), players consult a table
that pits one attribute against its opposing
attribute. The table provides a percentage
chance of the action succeeding.

==== Turn Order ====
Call of Cthulhu uses a karma-based
initiative system in which character actions
are ordered according to DEX, going from
highest to lowest. In the case of a tie, the
system becomes fortune-based with each
player rolling d100 and going in order from
lowest roll to highest.

==== Reward System ====

{{:game:call-of-cthulhu6.png }}
The first time a character successfully uses a skill
in a dangerous situation on an adventure, he gets to
place a check mark next to the skill on his sheet.
At the end of an adventure, the player then
determines if any of the check marked skills
improve. To do this, the player rolls d100. If the
result is greater than the skill’s current rank, the
player adds 1d10 to the rank of that skill. Thus, skills in which a character is a novice
improve easily, but those in which he is expert rarely improve with use.

If the resulting percentage increase raises a skill above the 90% mark, the player gets to
add 2d6 points to the character’s Sanity Points. Joy of joys! Your character gets to stay
sane a little longer!
