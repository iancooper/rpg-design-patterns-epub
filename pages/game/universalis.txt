//Universalis// (pronounced “universe-alice”) was written by Ralph Mazza and Mike
Holmes and is published by Ramshead Publishing. It is a storytelling game that so
defies common role-playing game design conventions that some people may balk at
calling it a role-playing game at all. //Universalis// has no Game Master. Or, from another
perspective, in //Universalis// all players are the Game Master. Players can create
characters at will, introduce new plot elements, and even seize control of other players’
characters. Nevertheless, it does incorporate what the author considers the essential
element of role-playing: players portray the roles of characters. If you’re playing a role,
then you’re role-playing. That concept seems pretty straightforward. And yet,
//Universalis// breaks all the rules. At the same time, it adopts some easily recognizable
design patterns of more traditional role-playing games.

//Universalis// provides no setting and is not geared toward any particular story genre.
Everything is left up to the players to create, with some rules governing how and when
story elements are introduced. There are even rules that govern how you can change the
rules if the players feel the urge.

The game sets up a simple economy through the distribution and use of “coins.” Facts
are introduced into the world by spending these coins. The more coins a player has, the
more potential he has in introducing new facts into the story. All players start with an
equal number of coins. More are distributed at the end of every scene. Coins are also
earned by introducing conflicts into the plot. This basic economy keeps any one player
from dominating the story to the exclusion of others. It ensures that everyone gets a
voice. It also encourages players to introduce facts that are harmful to their characters
(and others) in order to earn more coins. This design element is significant, because all
interesting stories involve some form of contention or dispute. Any storytelling game
lacking a Game Master needs some well crafted way to ensure conflicts arise.

The game starts with a clean slate. There is no prep-work to playing //Universalis//. Play
begins with players spending coins to set up the basic “Tenets” of the game. For
example, one group playing the game set up the following Tenets (each costing one
coin each): “The story is a mystery,” “It is set in cave-man times,” “No dinosaurs,”
“The mystery involves why no buffalo have arrived this year,” “Our meat stores are
low,” “The story is set in the prairie,” “We are tired of eating prairie dog meat,” “Our
tribal totem is the buffalo,” “Our enemies are the Crow totem people.” In setting up
these tenets, only the “No dinosaurs” tenet was disputed between players. One player
wanted dinosaurs while another did not. Most players did not care. The conflict
resolution rules handled the dispute smoothly with the “No dinosaurs” side winning the
contest.

==== Character Makeup ====
All characters have the single attribute of “Importance.”
Importance gauges how important the character is to the
story. It has a numeric value equal to the number of coins
spent on developing and equipping the character. To
permanently remove a character from play, a number of
coins must be spent equal to its Importance rating. Note
that this does not mean the character is killed. A character
can cease to appear in scenes without requiring his death.
Conversely, a dead character can re-appear in later scenes as a ghost or in flashbacks.

Characters also have traits. Traits are abilities and other characteristics established as
facts through the expenditure of coins by the players. Even a character’s name is a trait
that must be purchased. So are physical wounds.

Traits are ranked. Every coin spent on a trait increases its rank by 1. This, in turn,
increases the character’s Importance rating. So, if a character sustains a rank 2 wound
to his thigh, his Importance rises by 2 which actually makes it harder to eliminate the
character from the story.

==== Conflict System ====
Disputes between players are
resolved in two phases:
“Negotiation” and “Bidding.”
During Negotiation, the players
involved in the challenge try to
reach some mutually agreeable
solution. If this can be
accomplished, play then proceeds
without further interruption. However, if an agreement cannot be reached, the conflict
proceeds to the Bidding process. The challenger must bid at least one coin. If he does
not, he automatically loses the dispute. Assuming the challenger bids at least one coin,
the bidding process opens up for all players to contribute to either side. Any previously
established facts that are contradicted by either side can be used as additional leverage
in the bidding process. The side with the highest final bid wins.

If a player introduces a dispute between a component he controls and a component
under the control of someone else, a conflict arises. Each side in the conflict builds a
dice pool of d10s. All players can contribute to the dice pools. Dice are added to pools
by either drawing on a character’s traits (trait rank = # of dice) and/or buying dice by
spending coins (coins spent = # of dice). Traits can only be applied if they are
applicable to the confrontation. Once the dice pools are established, both sides roll. All
dice rolling 1 to 5 are considered successes, the rest are discarded. The side rolling the
greatest number of successes wins. Both sides contribute to the description of the
outcome. Naturally, the winner narrates first and the loser must accede to the winner’s
previously established facts.

==== Turn Order ====
Before each scene, each player makes a secret bid to frame the next scene. The highest
bidder gets to describe where the next scene takes place and what characters are initially
involved. The coins bid by the winning bidder are used by him to purchase facts in
framing the scene. The framer can describe the scene without interruption until the
scene’s location and time are determined and at least one component (character)
appears.

Turn order normally happens in a clockwise fashion from player to player. A player’s
turn ends when he either wants it to or he can no longer afford to introduce new story
elements due to a shortage of coins. However, any other player can “Interrupt” another
player and seize control of the storyline by spending one coin. Play then proceeds in a
clockwise fashion from the interrupting person after he is done.

==== Reward System ====
In any conflict involving opposed dice pools, the contest actually ends up generating
coins for both sides of the conflict. So, while characters can lose out in disputes,
players only benefit from them. The winner of the conflict adds up the results of all
dice that were successes and gains a number of coins equal to that value. The loser
gains a number of coins equal to the total number of dice he rolled in the conflict,
including both successes and failures. Both the winner and loser buy facts detailing the
outcome of the struggle equal to the number of coins generated by the dice. However,
both sides then get to keep their newly generated coins to replenish their pools. So, the
game essentially rewards conflict.
