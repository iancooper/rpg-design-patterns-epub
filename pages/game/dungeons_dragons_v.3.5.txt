//Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5//, published by Wizards of the Coast, is the most recent
edition of the venerated, much loved, and oft disparaged Dungeons and Dragons game
(originally written by Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax). It was the first and is, without a
doubt, the widest known role-playing game in existence. The game has evolved over
the years, but the fantasy setting and game focus of the current edition remains faithful
to its roots. The game is about pitting heroic characters against fantastic and fabulous
monsters, beating the beasts to a bloody pulp, gathering their loot, and earning
experience points. As play continues, characters accumulate treasure and power, thus
allowing them to challenge tougher and better equipped opponents.

==== Character Makeup ====

Characters have six primary attributes (“Abilities”) of “Strength,” “Dexterity,”
“Constitution,” “Intelligence,” “Wisdom,” and “Charisma” whose values are generated
by random dice rolls. Players must choose a race for their character as “Dwarf,” “Elf,”
“Gnome,” “Half-Orc,” “Half-Elf,” “Halfling,” or “Human” (other possibilities also
exist). The race provides adjustments to the basic attributes along with a variety of
other gifts. Each character has a small number of classes, usually one, chosen from
options such as “Fighter,” “Monk,” “Rogue,” and “Wizard.” Each class gives a
character access to special abilities, which improve as the character gains levels by
accumulating experience points. Skill ranks, whose costs are set by the character’s
class, and gifts (“Feats”) are also gained as characters gain levels. Characters
accumulate “Hit Points” as they gain levels by rolling dice and adding in adjustments
for Constitution. The character’s class determines the size of dice used.

==== Conflict System ====

Task resolution is determined by having a player
roll a single d20. When a character uses his
skills, the player adds various attribute and skill
bonuses, and compares the result to a threshold.
The result indicates either success or failure.
If the character is attempting to strike an
opponent with a weapon, various modifiers are
added to his roll, including the character’s “Base
Attack Bonus,” pertinent attribute bonuses, size
modifiers, and other miscellaneous modifiers.
This is compared to the target’s “Armor Class,”
which comprises the character’s “Armor Bonus,”
“Shield Bonus,” “Dex Bonus,” “Natural Armor,” and other miscellaneous bonuses. If
the blow lands, the player then rolls dice to determine damage depending on the weapon
used. If the d20 roll was high enough, the weapon may do double or triple damage.

==== Turn Order ====
Initiative is determined by having each combatant roll a d20 at the beginning of melee
and adding adjustments based on attributes and gifts. The order then proceeds in a
round-robin fashion until the conflict ends. A host of rules control what actions (and
how many) are allowed on each player’s turn.

==== Reward System ====
D&D rewards players by
giving their characters
experience points and
treasure for defeating foes.
The experience points
accumulate to determine a
character’s level. The
treasure is either used
directly, if it has its own in-
game purpose (such as a
Ring of Invisibility or a
Wand of Fireballs), or is
used to purchase items that
enhance the group’s ability
to slaughter ever more
powerful unsuspecting
beasties.
