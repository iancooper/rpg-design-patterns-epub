*Donjon* was written by Clinton R. Nixon and is published by Anvilwerks. The name is
a play on the word “dungeon” and the game is geared toward capturing the wonder and
excitement of many-a-gamers’ first experiences playing *Dungeons & Dragons*. Like
that ground-breaking game, the primary purpose of a *Donjon* character is to beat the
holy living heck out of any encountered monsters and loot them for booty. (Well, okay,
maybe they don’t have to kill every living thing they encounter, but the game definitely
encourages bloodshed and mayhem.) The game has a brilliant twist that sets it
distinctly apart from its predecessors. Players have as much input into the game world
as the game master. If a player searches for a secret door and succeeds in his roll, he
finds a secret door *whether the game master originally put one there or not!* If he
listens carefully for noises and succeeds in his roll, he hears a noise //and can describe
what it is that he hears!//

The player can introduce a number of facts into the world depending on how well he
succeeds on his contest rolls. So, the better the “hear noise” roll, the more detail he is
allowed to give to the noise he hears. In this way, he could potentially “hear” a troop of
sleeping goblins. The game master “fills in” the surrounding environment with facts of
his own as constrained by those stated by the players. So, while the character would
indeed hear the sounds of multiple goblin snores, there is still a lot left unspecified in
the encounter. If the player stated that there were many goblins and that they were
sleeping, it’s unlikely that he would be able to state what kind of treasure or weapons
they possessed. That leaves plenty of room for GM input to challenge the characters.
“Oh, too bad you didn’t check for traps. A bell jingles when you open the door. Let’s
see if any of the goblins wake up…”

### Character Makeup

{{ :game:donjon.png}}
Characters have six attributes of “Virility,”
“Cerebrality,” “Discernment,” “Wherewithal,”
and “Sociality” which range in value from one
to six. There are a number of ways to set these
values, but the “Standard” technique is to roll
them randomly taking the median roll of three
d6. Characters also have either a “Class” or
“Race” (never both). *Donjon* “Classes” and
“Races” are actually templates, because they
provide no niche protection, aside from that
enforced by the game master. Rather, the rules specify how the players create their own
templates by assigning traits (“Abilities”). There really is little difference between a
“Class” and a “Race,” but any character choosing a “Class” is assumed to be human and
all members of a “Race” have the same traits. Characters are also given a “Flesh
Wounds” attribute, which acts as hit points. Finally, character prowess is gauged in the
forms of levels and trait ranks.

### Conflict System

{{ :game:donjon2.png}}
*Donjon* uses dice pools of d20s to resolve conflicts (other die sizes may be substituted if
desired). The player rolls a number of d20s equal to his character’s pertinent attribute
plus his rank in any single appropriate trait. The game master does likewise and the
individual numbers are compared. The side with the highest number on any die wins.
The number of dice on the
winning side having a value
greater than the opponent’s
highest die indicates the
number of successes (with
ties counting as successes).
Successes can be transferred
to subsequent rolls (such as
damage for an attack roll) in
the form of additional dice.
Once a damaging attack
lands, a second conflict roll
determines how much
damage it delivers. The
aggressor rolls a number of
dice equal to the attack
successes + Virility + Weapon Damage Rating + any pertinent trait rank. The defender
rolls a number of dice equal to his Wherewithal + Armor Damage Rating + any
pertinent trait rank. The successes from this second conflict roll are subtracted from the
target’s hit points (“Flesh Wounds”).

However, the most interesting use of successes resulting from a conflict roll is the
ability to translate them into facts as described above. So, a success translates to either
an additional die on a follow-on roll or a fact, whichever the player wants.

### Turn Order

Donjon combat is divided into “Flurries.” A flurry
is a sequence of rapid attacks and counterattacks
taken by both sides. To determine who goes when
during a flurry, each player rolls a number of d20s
equal to his character’s “Discernment” attribute
plus his Level. Each of these represents the timing
of an action. The game master counts down from
20. Every time someone has an initiative die with
the stated number, his character is allowed to perform an action.

### Reward System

{{ :game:donjon4.png}}
Donjon rewards players with experience points
when they kill things. The game is quite clear
that no experience is awarded unless the
creature is left in a bloody mound. If it
somehow limps, crawls, or staggers away, as
the Soup Nazi would say, *“No XP for you!”*
The total number of experience points earned
by a character determines his level. Every
level he gains, a character gains 5 “Leveling
Dice.” These can be applied to trait ranks, hit
points, or “Saving Throws,” but the character’s
level determines the maximum number that can
be spent in any area. In addition, characters
gain bonuses to their attribute scores as they
gain levels.
