//Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing// is published by Iron Crown Enterprises, Inc.
Rolemaster is considered by many to be the poster child for highly detailed table driven
combat systems. It is a combat-oriented, Tolkienesque fantasy game with men, elves,
dwarfs, and halflings. Much of the supplemental material of the first edition was
heavily focused on Tolkien’s Middle Earth. (Actually, the Middle Earth supplements
were written for a “Rolemaster-lite” game called //MERP// – //Middle Earth Role Playing// –
published by the same company. But, the games were so similar that many people used
the //MERP// supplements for Rolemaster games.) Unfortunately, the Lord of the Rings
material was eventually dropped. (Rumor has it that this move was primarily due to
prohibitive royalties demanded by the Tolkien estate for use of the content, but the
author has seen nothing official verifying this supposition.)

==== Character Makeup ====
The power of a Rolemaster
character is gauged as a numeric
“Level,” which rises as characters
gain experience points. In
addition, characters have 10
attributes (“Stats”): “Agility”
(Ag), “Constitution” (Co),
“Memory” (Me), “Reasoning”
(Re), “Self Discipline” (SD),
“Empathy” (Em), “Intuition” (In),
“Presence” (Pr), “Quickness”
(Qu), and “Strength” (St). These
range in value from 1 to 101.
Players initially set these values by
spending points from a resource
pool. (The size of the resource
pool can be determined in various
ways, but it ends up being around
660 points.) The amount to which
these can be raised is limited by
the character’s “Potential Stats,”
which have no other function in the game than to indicate how good a character’s
attributes can possibly become. The attribute values are modified slightly depending on
the character’s Race (“Common Man,” “High Man,” “Wood Elf,” “Halfling,” etc.).

Characters also have a litany of skills. Each of these has a rank, which is purchased
through the expenditure of “Development Points,” or “DPs.” The cost of each rank is
based on the character’s class (“Profession”), such as “Fighter,” “Rogue,” “Cleric,”
“Magician,” etc. As character’s gain levels, they earn more DPs that they can spend on
raising the ranks of their various skills. Depending on the skill and class, some skills
allow a character to only gain a single rank per level. In others, two or even three ranks
can be purchased. Quite often, the cost to gain a second rank in a particular skill is
considerably more expensive than the first. Again, these costs depend on both the skill
in which the character is gaining a rank and the class possessed by the character.

Each skill has a skill bonus. The skill bonus is the sum of a number of modifiers. First
is the skill category rank bonus, which is derived from the skill rank through the means
of a table lookup. To this a pertinent attribute is added (depending on the nature of the
skill) along with a class bonus, if any. Finally, any special adjustments are added. All
of this work is done during character preparation, so that the overall total is available for
immediate use during play.

==== Conflict System ====
Rolemaster uses classic
task resolution.
Characters attempt
various actions using
their skills. All skill
rolls use percentile dice
(d100) to generate a
random number in an
“open ended” roll. An
open ended roll is
performed as follows:
Roll the d100 and note
the result. If the rolled
value fell into the range
of 95-100, the dice are
rolled again and the
results added together.
If the second roll again comes up in the range of 95-100, the player keeps rolling and
accumulating greater and greater success until a value less than 95 is rolled and the
sequence stops. On the other hand, if the initial rolled value fell into the range of 01-05,
the dice are rolled again in an open ended fashion, but with the results being subtracted
from the character’s success instead of added.

To perform contests, the player makes an open-ended roll. To the result is added the
character’s skill bonus along with any situational modifiers. Finally, to this result is
added another modifier based on the difficulty of the task. For easy tasks, this modifier
is positive. For difficult tasks, it is
negative. Once the overall sum is
obtained, the result is determined
through a table lookup.

For combat attacks, the “difficulty
modifier” of any attack attempt is the
opponent’s “Defensive Bonus,” or
“DB”. DB indicates how difficult it
is for an opponent to strike a
character or monster in combat. It is
derived from the Quickness attribute
and is modified by the type of armor
worn along with any magical
adjustments. If a weapon strikes, it
delivers damage that lowers the
target’s hit points and inflicts other
effects, such as bleeding and combat
penalties of various sorts. The effects
of a successful combat attack actually
involve two rolls and two table
lookups. The first is essentially an
attack roll that determines damage and a criticality factor. The second determines any
special damage effects based on the criticality factor.

==== Turn Order ====
Each combat round is split up into five
phases. These phases exist to enable
players to try to get their actions in
before those of their opponents (with
penalties). Conversely, a player may
also delay his character’s actions in
order to let him find the best
opportunity to strike. So, players can
decide to make “Snap,” “Normal,” or
“Deliberate” actions.

{{ :game:rolemaster5.png}}
  - Action Declaration Phase - all players declare what actions they are attempting. The declarations are performed in no particular order.
  - Initiative Determination Phase – all players roll 2d10 and add their Quickness bonus. This gives them an Initiative value.
  - Snap Action Phase – resolve all “Snap” actions in the order determined by the Initiative roll. These actions get a penalty.
  - Normal Action Phase – resolve all “Normal” actions in the order determined by the Initiative roll.
  - Deliberate Action Phase – resolve all “Deliberate” actions in the order determined by the Initiative roll. These actions gain a bonus.

==== Reward System ====
Characters are awarded experience points for successful actions and for sustaining
damage. The amount of experience awarded depends on the character’s level and the
difficulty of the actions and the criticalities of the wounds sustained and delivered. The
values are determined by, you guessed it, table lookups. Experience points are also
earned for introducing ideas and concepts that help out on the adventure, for travel in
unfamiliar territory, and for whatever else the GM decides to reward. When enough
experience points accumulate, the character gains a level.
