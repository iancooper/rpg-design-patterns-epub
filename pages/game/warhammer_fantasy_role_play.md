*Warhammer Fantasy Role Play* is published by Games Workshop Ltd. It is a traditional
fantasy game that pits the forces of Law against those of Chaos with the heroes getting
stuck somewhere in the middle. The main rulebook includes a broad overview of the
“The Known World,” whose map is obviously a distortion of Earth’s map. It contains a
number of lands, including “Albion” (England), “The Old World” (Europe), and “The
New World” (North America). Player characters generally come from somewhere in
“The Old World.”

### Character Makeup

Warhammer has a Tolkienesque setting
allowing players to choose from the
standard fantasy races of “Man,” “Wood
Elf,” “Dwarf,” and “Halfling.” Once this
is done, the player selects an alignment for
his character from the choices of
“Chaotic,” “Evil,” “Neutral”, “Good”, and
“Lawful”. In some places, the game text
states that the alignment associated with a
race must be taken by the player for his
character. At other points, though, the text
states that alignment is a choice. Due to
these contradictory statements, there is
these contradictory statements, there is
little doubt that the majority of players end up choosing the alignment they want to play.

Once the race is chosen, a character’s 13 primary attribute values can be determined.
The various attributes are: “Movement” (M), “Weapon Skill” (WS), “Ballistic Skill”
(BS), “Strength” (S), “Toughness” (T), “Initiative” (I), “Attacks” (A), “Dexterity”
(Dex), “Leadership” (Ld), “Intelligence” (Int), “Cool” (Cl), “Willpower” (WP), and
“Fellowship” (Fel). Characters also have a “Wounds” (W) resource that acts as a form
of hit points. The rules contain a table indicating what dice and formulas should be
used for calculating the attributes. So, the Ballistic Skill of an Elf is “2d10+20” while
the Strength of a Man is “d3+1”. Some attributes end up having values lying in the
range of 2 to 50 while others range from 1 to 4. In fact, “Attacks,” an attribute
indicating how many attacks a character gets in a round of combat, always starts at 1.
There is no absolute uniformity of number range from one attribute to the next.
However, many of them are used in contests by comparing the number to a roll of d100.
Those that are used in this fashion fall into the 2 to 50 range initially.

Characters also have a resource knows as “Fate Points.” Fate Points follows the Safety
Valve Design Pattern in preventing premature character death.

Once the attributes and Fate Points are determined, the player selects one of four
“Career Classes” for his character from the following list: “Warrior,” “Ranger,”
“Rogue,” and “Academics.” The “Career Class” is actually a class category, because
each category is associated with a table that is used by the player to randomly determine
his character’s “Career.” It is the randomly selected “Career” that actually follows the
Class Design Pattern. The number of class possibilities is impressive. It includes
entries as wide ranging as “Alchemist’s Apprentice,” “Beggar,” “Initiate,”
“Mercenary,” “Rat Catcher,” and “Squire.” Each class gives a list of gifts (“Skills”)
along with chances to obtain them, equipment, attribute adjustments that characters can
earn as they progress in the career, and “Career Exits.” The career exits enable a
character with a given class to advance to some other class. When he does, his loses his
old career exits and gains a new set of career exits.

Warhammer “skills” actually fit this book’s definition of “gifts,” since no ranks are ever
gained in them and they do not improve as play progresses. (The attributes on which
they are based do improve, however.) Their list of gifts is quite lengthy. It includes
options such as “Boat Building,” “Gamble,” “Mining,” “Night Vision,” and “Strike
Mighty Blow.”

### Conflict System

Contests are performed by first determining
whether a character has the gifts necessary to
attempt an action. If so, the player rolls d100 and
compares the result to his character’s pertinent
attribute. If the result is less than the attribute
value, the task succeeds.

In combat, the pertinent attribute to use in attacking an opponent is “Weapon Skill.” If
the hit succeeds, damage is determined by rolling a d6 and adding the aggressor’s
Strength. The target’s Toughness attribute is then deducted from the result to give a
damage amount. The hit location is then determined by reversing the numbers rolled on
the d100 and performing a
table lookup (i.e., an attack
roll of 83 becomes a hit
location of 38 on the table).
The armor rating of the struck
body part is subtracted from
the damage to give a final
damage total. This damage
value is subtracted from the
character’s hit points
(“Wounds”).

If the d6 used in the damage roll results in a 6, the player has a chance for additional
damage. To do so, he must roll another d100 and compare it to his “Weapon Skill”
attribute. If the roll is once again less than this value, the player adds another d6 to his
damage. If a 6 is rolled again on the d6, additional d6s are accumulated as long as 6s
are rolled in an open-ended fashion.

Warhammer hit points work in an interesting way. When a character’s “Wounds”
resource drops to zero, the character does not fall. Rather, he finally starts taking real
wounds. That is, he starts accumulating “Critical Hits” that have serious consequences
to the character’s health such as incapacitation or death. These are determined by cross
indexing the inflicted damage with another percentile roll. This, along with the hit
location, determines the actual wound delivered. Severed limbs, broken bones, and
death are common results.

### Turn Order

When opposing forces first meet, anyone unaware of
the opposition is automatically surprised and cannot
attack on their first round of combat. Otherwise,
action order goes from the character with the highest
“Initiative” attribute and proceeds sequentially on
down to the character with the lowest Initiative value.
So, initiative is purely Karma-based.

### Reward System

Warhammer rewards players by giving their characters experience points. Experience
points are awarded for attaining an adventure’s goals and “good role-playing.” These
points can be spent to buy new gifts and to raise attribute values. These are limited,
however, to the “advance scheme” of the current
class. Once the maximum advancement for an
attribute has been attained in a class, the player
cannot raise that attribute further until he progresses
to the next class, which must be one of the available
“career exits” listed in the class description. Any
player wishing to have his character advance to
another class must expend experience points to do
so.
