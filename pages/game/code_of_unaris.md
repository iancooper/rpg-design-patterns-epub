*Code of Unaris* was written by Gary Pratt and is published by GoldLeaf Games. It is a
game designed specifically to support role-playing on Internet chat sites. The game’s
premise is that a renegade computer program has inadvertently created a wormhole to
an ancient past set in the world of Unaris. One billion years ago, Earth's moon was lush
and fertile, supporting an ancient human civilization of medieval level technology and
fantastic magic. The mysterious Internet program not only allows players to see into
this remarkable past, but also allows them to alter it in small ways so that history may
be altered. This is fortunate, because one powerful mage, known as The Warlock, has
taken notice of the wormhole's influence. His goal is to eradicate mankind forever, so
his discovery that mankind has survived a billion years is disconcerting to him. His
knowledge of the wormhole, though, may allow him to correct his mistakes and make
humankind's downfall a reality. It is the players’ collective responsibility to see to it
that this does not happen.

### Character Makeup

Characters are created through the expenditure of “Bonus Points,” or “Character
Points.” Generally, players start their character designs from given templates. Players
thereafter spend their Bonus Points in customizing their characters. These points are
spent primarily in gaining ranks in various skills, such as “Jump” and “Alchemy” and
may gain “Special Abilities” (Gifts) such as “Cold Resistant” or “Quickdraw.”
Characters also have “Reputations,” such as “Charming,” “Hot-Headed,” or “Snooty.”
Reputations provide modifiers to various pertinent skills. All characters start with a
single reputation, but more can be accumulated (and/or dropped) as play progresses.
Characters also have a number of “Life Points,” which act as hit points.

### Conflict System

The most original mechanic in the game is known as "hacking." Hacking is a process
by which statements of recent past events or circumstances stated by the Game Master
may be altered. Every session, each player starts with 20 Hack Points. The alteration
of a single word costs a player one Hack Point. Changing a quantity up or down by
50% costs a player 2 Hack Points. In this way, a player can alter the circumstances of
the game world so that an unfavorable situation can be transformed into a favorable
one. “A lit bomb lands at your feet” could potentially be hacked into “A lit torch lands
at your feet.” Thereafter, conflict resolution is very simple. When one skill is pitted
against that of an opponent, the higher skill rank wins.

### Turn Order

*Code of Unaris* takes advantage of the fact that it is a game specifically designed to
support role-playing in Internet chat rooms. The order in which actions are taken is the
order in which they are entered into the chat session. Thus, the faster you type, the
higher the priority of your actions.

### Reward System

The game master rewards players at the end of a session by giving them Bonus Points.
The amount of points awarded depends on if they completed the mission, how heroic
the players portrayed their characters, how inventive they were in overcoming their
opposition, for pushing the story forward, and for how well the character’s role was
played.
