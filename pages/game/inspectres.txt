//InSpectres// was written by Jared A Sorensen and is published by Memento Mori
Theatricks. The game is quite honest about its blatant adoption of ideas from the
GhostBuster movies. In the game, the characters set up an InSpectres franchise that
specializes in //“Battling the Forces of Darkness So You Don’t Have To.”// The setting is
modern day San Francisco with the exception that ghosts and spooks are common,
everyday pests. The characters (agents) are exterminators.

Stories are strictly structured: A client contacts the franchise to deal with some
paranormal menace; the agents investigate the problem through interviews and other
research; the characters beg, borrow, or otherwise acquire the gear needed to defeat the
bad guys before heading out into the field; the agents wrangle with the nasties,
defeating them in whatever fashion presents itself; the franchise collects its fee; and the
characters take a vacation until the next client shows up.

//InSpectres// noticeably lacks any form of Hit Points. Characters simply cannot die from
their ordeals unless a player decides that his character’s death would be entertaining.
So, players are free to hose their characters in any variety of comical ways.

One unique concept in //InSpectres// is known as a “Confessional.” This is a point where a
player has his character talk directly to the other players. Not the other //characters//,
mind you, the other //players//. It is equivalent to an actor in a movie looking directly to
the camera and addressing the audience. The Confessional allows a player to
foreshadow events that he would like to see in upcoming scenes or to introduce new
information or plot twists that the players, but not necessarily the characters know
about: “As the crew fled from the cackling banshee down isle four of the FoodMart,
little did we realize how crucial pickled eggs would be to our salvation.”

==== RPG Design Patterns Identified ====
[[:pattern:Attribute]], [[:pattern:Dice Pool]], [[:pattern:Endgame]], [[:pattern:Faction]] (Heroes vs. spooks), [[:pattern:Game Master]], [[:pattern:Narrative
Reward]], [[:pattern:Negotiated Contest]], [[:pattern:Point Spend Gauge]], [[:pattern:Resource]], [[:pattern:Shared Gauge]] (“Library
Card,” “Gym Card,” “Credit Card,” “Bank”), [[:pattern:Shared Power]], [[:pattern:Structured Story]], [[:pattern:Traits]],
[[:pattern:Trauma Gauge]] (stress reduces the effectiveness of attributes)

==== Character Makeup ====
//InSpectres// characters have four primary attributes: “Academics,” “Athletics,”
“Technology,” and “Contact.” “Normal” characters (i.e., humans) are given 9 dice to
distribute to these four attributes, but all must lie in the range of 1 to 4. “Weird”
characters (i.e., werewolves, vampires, etc.) are given 10 dice to spend, with each
attribute value falling into the range of 0 to 10. The game allows only one weird agent
per game.

There are two additional attributes of “Current Stress” and “Current Cool.” Cool has a
range of 0 to 3 for “Normal” characters, but is unlimited for “Weird” characters.

Each “Normal” character is given a unique trait
(“Talent”) by his player that makes him special.
These can be as wide ranging as “Airplane
Mechanic,” “Baseball Card Collector,” “Trivial
Pursuit guru,” “Green Beret,” or “Dr. Who Fan.”
“Weird” characters lack this benefit. They do,
however, get “Powers.” (A vampire might be able
to turn into a bat, for example.)

One other very important aspect of the character
makeup is not actually part of the character at all.
The InSpectres franchise has its own attributes that
are shared among all of the franchise members.
These are: Library Card, Gym Card, and Credit Card. These can be used by any of the
franchise members to augment rolls dealing with Academics, Athletics, and
Technology, respectively. Beginning franchises start with 5 dice to distribute among
the three cards. Any leftovers go into the Bank attribute. Dice in the bank can be used
to augment any roll, but are sometimes inaccessible.

Franchise cards are really the only attributes in the game that improve with time. As the
franchise prospers, all of its agents prosper along with it. As the franchise wanes, so too
do its employees.

==== Conflict System ====
All conflicts use a number of d6s equal to the
value of whatever attribute is most pertinent.
So, if the conflict requires physical exertion, a
character’s Athletics attribute would most
likely be the pertinent score. The dice are
rolled and the highest single number rolled on
any dice is used in a table lookup to determine
the outcome. In general, the higher the
outcome, the more control the player has over
describing the outcome. Low rolls give the
game master narrative control. If the highest
number is a 5 or 6, the group earns franchise
dice, which pushes the story closer to the
endgame. Also, note that the conflict roll does
not pit the player characters’ skills against
those of the monsters. Monster capabilities
don’t really enter into the picture in any
mechanical way.

The conflict roll can be augmented with dice
from the Bank or from the franchise cards,
whichever is pertinent to the task at hand. These dice are “spent.” But, depending on
the roll of the actual Bank dice (which are distinguished by a different color), you may
actually get the dice back, lose an additional die, lose all of the remaining dice in the
Bank, or even earn more dice to add to the Bank. The result is determined by a table
lookup.

Characters can assist one another in conflicts. To do so, they must first state that they
are assisting a comrade prior to rolling any dice for their own actions. Once the dice are
rolled, the assisting player must hand over one of the dice he rolled to the player he is
helping.

{{ :game:inspectres3.png}}
Anytime the game master deems it appropriate, he can call
for a “Stress Roll.” This is a special kind of conflict roll
where the player rolls a number of d6, takes the lowest
number, and performs a table lookup to determine the
mechanical effects. Cool points mitigate the effects of stress.
For every point of Cool, a character ignores one dice in any
Stress Roll after the dice are rolled. So, a character with 2
points of Cool only has to consider the “best” die in any 3
dice Stress Roll. Franchise cards and other players are
unable to assist Stress Rolls. Possible outcomes include
gaining a point of Cool, suffering penalties on future conflict rolls, or losing points from
various attributes. The causes of these mechanical effects are up to the players
themselves. Lost trait points are regained at the end of each mission (when the
character takes a vacation) or by spending Cool points.

==== Turn Order ====
//InSpectres// has no explicit rules governing the order in which players take turns. The
conflict resolution system is set up in such a way that this isn’t really necessary. A high
conflict roll allows the player to describe what he’d like to see while a low roll indicates
the game master gets that pleasure.

==== Reward System ====
The game rewards players with “Franchise Dice,” which also works as an Endgame
mechanic. At the beginning of every mission, the game master decides on how many
franchise dice the story is worth. (The rulebook provides guidelines on what is
reasonable.) Throughout the adventure, players earn these franchise dice through
conflict rolls. When the pre-specified number of franchise dice has been earned, the
game master declares victory and gives the dice to the franchise. Franchise dice
augment the group’s Library Card, Gym Card, Credit Card, and Bank attributes. The
episode ends with the characters taking a well-earned vacation.
