//Hero System 5<sup>th</sup> Edition// was written by Steven S. Long and is published by DOJ, Inc. It
is the descendant of //Champions//, a super-heroes RPG first published in 1981 by Hero
Games. Touting itself as “The Ultimate Gamer’s Toolkit,” Hero System is designed to
be appropriate for “ordinary” heroic adventures as well as super-hero style play. At
first glance, the daunting 372 page manual might be mistaken for a textbook rather than
a game book. Its pages contain a vast array of pre-defined abilities that can be tailored
to a player’s character concept. The system allows characters to be highly customized,
allowing each to have unique abilities, equipment, and powers.

==== Character Makeup ====
Hero characters have eight primary attributes (“Characteristics”): “Strength,”
“Dexterity,” “Constitution,” “Body,” “Intelligence,” “Ego,” “Presence,” and
“Comeliness.” Their values are specified by having players spend “Character Points”
and the costs vary from attribute to attribute. The genre of game, whether heroic or
super-heroic, determines the number of points distributed to players to generate their
characters. After setting the primary attribute values, players derive six more attributes
from the primary ones via various formulae. These derived attributes are: “Physical
Defense,” “Energy Defense,” “Speed,” “Recovery,” “Endurance,” and “Stun.”

Body and “Stun” are both hit points attributes. Characters fall unconscious when Stun
drops to zero. They start dying when Body falls to 0 and truly die when it drops to -10.
Characters also possess two additional derived attributes known as “Combat Value” and
“Ego Combat Value,” which gauge character effectiveness in combat and mental
actions, respectively. Combat Value is further adjusted by various skill ranks,
equipment, and other factors to produce both an “Offensive Combat Value” and a
“Defensive Combat Value.”

Players purchase skills (Skills and Powers)
and gifts (Perks and Talents) for their
characters using Character Points.
Character Points also buy skill ranks at costs
that vary from skill to skill. Players can
earn additional Character Points by
accepting flaws (Disadvantages) for their
characters.

Powers are particularly notable, in that they
are skills that essentially define mechanical
effects without specifying “special effects.” For example, the game provides an
“Energy Blast” power. A player may customize this power to fit his character concept
by describing it as the power to cast thundering lightning bolts from his fingertips,
summon blazing spheres of greenish flames from the heavens, or shoot laser beams
from a blaster. Essentially, all Energy Blast powers have the same mechanical effect.
Their differences mainly involve presentation. So, players craft powers to match their
character concepts rather than the other way around. Despite their flexibility, hero
powers qualify as “skills” rather than “traits” because the various powers are pre-
defined, even though their superficial appearance is entirely in the players’ control.

==== Conflict System ====
To perform a combat attack, a
player rolls 3d6 and sums the
result. A blow lands if the sum
is less than or equal to a value
determined by both the
attacker’s Offensive Combat
Value and the defender’s
Defensive Combat Value (11 +
OCV – DCV). Mental attacks
use a similar technique,
replacing Ego Combat Value
for “Combat Value.

If an attack lands, it inflicts
damage on the target.
Depending on the nature of the
attack, the damage may be subtracted from either Stun or Body (or both). Stun attacks
can knock an opponent out, but cannot kill. Body attacks can kill. Physical Defenses
(such as armor) and Energy Defenses (such as force fields) can modify the amount of
damage actually sustained by a character from an attack.

==== Turn Order ====
Combat is segmented into 12 second “turns.”
A character’s Speed attribute determines
number and timing of his combat actions every
turn. If a character has a 3 Speed, he gets three
actions (“Phases”) every turn. The timing of
those actions is determined by a table lookup.
For example, a character with a 3 Speed
performs his actions on 4th, 8th, and 12th second
of every turn since that is what the table
specifies. For characters acting on the same
second, the action order goes from highest
Dexterity to lowest.

Some actions count as “Full Moves” while others count as “Half Moves.” In general, a
character can perform either one Full Move or two Half Moves during each combat
“Phase.” If a character performs a half
move before an attack, then the attack
counts as a half move. But, a character
cannot perform an attack and then enact
a half move. Once a character makes an
attack, his Phase is over.

==== Reward System ====
The game master rewards players by
giving their characters experience
points, which are spent just like
Character Points. Each session is
generally worth at least 1 experience
point, but players can earn more by
being clever, role-playing well, solving
a mystery, etc.
