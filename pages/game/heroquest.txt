//HeroQuest// was written by Robin D. Laws and Greg Stafford and is published by
Issaries, Inc. It is a fantasy game set in the world of Glorantha during the “Hero Wars.”
Created by Greg Stafford, Glorantha is a rich fantasy world originally conceived in
1966 before RPG’s even existed. It has evolved over the years attracting many writers
and gamers in the process. Glorantha was used as the setting for //RuneQuest//, but was
divorced from that game after Chaosium sold //RuneQuest// to Avalon Hill. (Avalon Hill
was eventually taken over by TSR, which was sold to Wizards of the Coast along with
the rights to D&D. WotC was eventually acquired by Hasbro. Needless to say, Hasbro
decided D&D didn’t need the competition and //RuneQuest// died an unfortunate death.)
//HeroQuest// actually came much later than Glorantha, is more free-form in its design
than //RuneQuest//, and is tailored specifically to the world.

==== Character Makeup ====
//HeroQuest// characters are almost entirely trait
based. All characters possess a resource known
as “Hero Points” that are spent in raising ranks
in the character’s various traits. It can also be
expended to improve the outcomes of conflicts
in the hero’s favor.

All characters do have a “State of Health,”
though, that follows the Trauma Gauge design pattern. The trait can take on one of the
following states: “Healthy,” “Hurt,” “Impaired,” “Injured,” “Dying,” or “Dead.”
However, this is not a strict ranking, because a character can have multiple “Hurts,”
each of which has a detrimental effect on the character’s capabilities.

The remaining character traits fall into the six categories of “Skills,” “Relationships,”
“Magical Abilities,” “Personality,” “Followers,” and “Possessions & Wealth.” (To
avoid confusion, please note that the “Skills” category is really a list of trait abilities and
does not conform to this book’s definition of the term “skill.”) Characters also have a
number of “Keywords.” Keywords are especially important in that they convey a
character’s “Homeland,” “Occupation,” “Magic,” and “Common Magic.” Keywords
are very broad ranked traits which incorporate everything associated with the culture or
profession specified. Here we call Keywords “traits” rather than “skills,” even though
there are pre-defined write-ups of them in the rulebook. Although these write-ups are
often used directly, they really only comprise an extensive list of examples. That is,
players are encouraged to create their own as well. So, players either make up their
own Keywords or select them from a list of examples. (You could rightly claim that
HQ Keywords fall halfway between this book’s definition of “skill” and “trait.”) Even
though the Keywords have ranks, they also act as templates, giving lists of suggested
traits that characters with the keyword should commonly adopt. For example, the
Occupation of “Hunter” suggests characters take the “Archery,” “Track,” and
“Wilderness Survival” traits, among others.

Traits are ranked but the ranking scheme is not a simple numeric value. Rather, each
trait has a numeric value and a “mastery” value. Twenty is the largest numeric value
allowed. If the rank is increased to 21, it automatically drops to 1 and the mastery value
associated with the rank increases by 1. Masteries are denoted by the runic symbol ᛗ
in HeroQuest. So, a rank 13 trait with 2 masteries is denoted as 13 2.

==== Conflict System ====

Conflicts are handled as
either “simple contests” or
“extended contests.” A
simple contest is one which
takes only moments to
resolve and do not
necessarily deal with the
primary purpose of the
campaign. Simple contests
are handled with a single
die roll. Extended contests,
on the other hand, are
conflicts that take more
time to resolve. They are
essentially broken down
into a number of smaller
conflicts and commonly
require several die rolls to determine a victor.

//HeroQuest// uses opposed d20 rolls to determine success in conflicts. Each d20 roll is
compared to a threshold (determined by the rank of the skill being used by each side).
If the die roll comes up as a 1, the action succeeds brilliantly. If it comes up greater
than one but less than the threshold, the character succeeds normally. If the result is
greater than the target number but less than 20, the action fails. And, finally, if the die
rolls a 20 the character fails horribly. These four degrees of success and failure are
labeled “Critical,” “Success,” “Failure,” and “Fumble.”

These degrees of success and failure can be “Bumped” up or down in two ways. First,
if the character has masteries in the trait being used greater than that of his opponent, he
can bump the success result up by the difference in masteries. Second, Hero Points can
be used to bump the result. Either way, a Failure can be bumped up to a Success or a
Success can be bumped up to a Critical. If a character has masteries “left over” after
bumping his success up to Critical, he can apply the remaining masteries to bump down
his opponent’s success.

{{:game:heroquest3.png }}
The resulting degrees of
success and failure of both
sides are compared.
Depending on the
difference in these
outcomes, the overall
“level of victory” of the
winner is: “Tied,”
“Marginal,” “Minor,”
Major,” or “Complete.”

In extended contests, the
ongoing success of each
side is rated in the form of “Advantage Points,” or “APs.” These are initially set based
on the rank of the trait being applied as the first action of the conflict. The values wax
and wane as each side makes gains or suffers losses in the contest. Before each roll,
each side makes an AP bid. Depending on the degree of success of the winner on every
roll, the AP bid is multiplied by a value. Depending on both sides the degrees of
success in their rolls, the AP is then either merely subtracted from the loser’s AP or
actually transferred from the loser to the winner. When either side’s AP total drops to
zero or less, the contest is over. The end result of the contest depends on the loser’s
final AP total as determined by a table lookup. For combat, a character’s State of
Health can be altered to Hurt, Impaired, Injured, or Dying.

==== Turn Order ====
On the first action of an extended contest, the
aggressor’s action goes first followed by his
opponent’s. If the contest is not over (neither
side’s AP total has dropped to zero or less), a
new round begins with each person taking his
turn in a round robin fashion. So, in general,
the same character takes the first action on each
round.

==== Reward System ====
HeroQuest rewards players through the
distribution of Hero Points. At the start of
every adventure, each character gains 1 to 5
points. A long and arduous adventure lasting
several sessions will earn a character another
1 to 5 points, depending on the group’s
overall success and on the quality of role-
play.
