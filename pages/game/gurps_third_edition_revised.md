*GURPS* (Generic Universal Role-Playing System) is published by Steve Jackson
Games. True to its name, it is a role-playing framework independent of any particular
setting or genre. That is not to say that there aren’t many supplements available to
provide these details, though, both generic and specific fictional settings. It is just that
the system itself is not geared toward any one in particular. *GURPS* supplements span
the spectrum from low-tech fantasy to high-tech sci-fi along with just about any
combination in-between.

### Character Makeup

{{ :game:gurps.png}}
*GURPS* characters are designed using a system based purely on “Character Points.”
Character Points are a resource that players spend to customize their characters.
Different “Skills” and “Advantages” cost varying amounts of Character Points
depending on their difficulty and overall usefulness. Additional Character Points can be
gained by accepting various “Disadvantages” and “Quirks.” Characters have four
primary attributes of “Strength,”
“Dexterity,” “Intelligence,” and
“Dexterity,” “Intelligence,” and
“Health” whose values are adjusted
based on the character’s chosen race.
These attributes usually range in value
between 1 and 18, but can extend even higher if a player is willing to sacrifice
elsewhere. Their values are set
depending on the number of Character
Points spent and the costs are based on
a table lookup. Unusually low scores
earn a player more points to spend
elsewhere. Characters also have “Hit
Points,” which are based on the Health
attribute.

Skills are ranked. Like everything else in the game, skill ranks are determined by how
many Character Points are expended on the skill. The rating also factors in both the
skill “Difficulty” and the primary attribute of Dexterity or Intelligence, depending on
whether the skill is physical or mental in nature. Although the skill rank, or “Level,”
takes into account all these various components, the rating is essentially a primary
attribute added to a skill adjustment purchased with Character Points.

Characters also have a “Move” attribute that is derived from Health and Dexterity. This
score represents the number of yards a character can run in a second. Characters have a
number of other derived attributes as well: “Dodge,” “Parry,” “Fatigue,” “Block,”
“Damage Resistance,” “Encumbrance,” etc.

### Conflict System

Conflicts are resolved by rolling 3d6, summing the numbers, and then comparing the
total to a set threshold. The threshold generally equals a character’s pertinent attribute
or skill rank, but may be adjusted due to circumstances. If the rolled sum is less than or
equal to the threshold, the character succeeds. Otherwise, he fails.

If two characters compete against one another, the resolution technique is different
based on whether the contest is “quick” or “regular.” A quick contest is one that is over
is about a second. Both sides of the contest roll as above. The winner is the character
who succeeded by the most or failed by the least. If the roll results in a tie, neither side
wins. Regular contests take more time. If one side succeeds on his roll and the other
fails, the contest goes to the winner. If both fail or both succeed, the contest is not yet
decided and both sides must re-roll until one side is victorious.

For conflicts involving combat, *GURPS* is a traditional “roll-to-hit, roll-to-damage”
system. If an attack hits, dice are rolled to determine how much damage is inflicted.
This value can be altered by armor via its “Damage Rating,” which is subtracted from
the rolled damage. The remainder is subtracted from the character’s hit points (Health).

### Turn Order

The order of combat actions is purely Karma-based. The Move attributes of characters
are compared. Those with higher Move scores go first. Once everyone has gotten his
turn, the cycle repeats until the conflict ends.

### Reward System

Since *GURPS* is entirely based on Character Points, it is no surprise that the game’s sole
reward system consists of the game master awarding these to players. This is done at
the end of every gaming session and represents a reward for “Good Play.” The award
incorporates the GM’s judgment of the quality of role-play and his assessment of the
characters’ progress toward their stated missions. The amount awarded can range
anywhere from -5 to 5 points per character, so the “reward” can actually be a penalty if
the players do a particularly poor job.
