*Elfs* was written by Ron Edwards and is published by Adept Press. It is a light-hearted
lark of a game where all characters are obnoxiously selfish pointy-eared elves, er, elfs.
The game is a satire of traditional fantasy role-playing games that mercilessly pokes fun
at the loot gathering behaviors exhibited by players of those games. Its most innovative
feature is the way in which it separates character and player goals in conflicts. A player
can state what his character is attempting to accomplish and, at the same time, specify
some other goal that he, as a player, wants to see happen. The result can be that one,
neither, or both goals are attained.

### Character Makeup

Characters have three core attributes: “Spunk,” “Dumb
Luck,” and “Low Cunning.” Spunk is initially set to a
value of 5 while the others are set to zero. Dumb Luck
and Low Cunning can be raised by spending Spunk
points. Each point of Spunk gives the player two points
to distribute to the other attributes. Characters also have
an idiom called “Stage” which can be set to “Oral,”
“Anal,” or “Genital.” Oral characters are always on the
lookout for food. Anal characters are fart factories.
Genital characters are, well, depraved. Characters
gather treasure in the form of magic items and “Coins,”
which can be spent on nifty new equipment.

### Conflict System

*Elfs* uses a dice pool system for contests consisting of 3d10. The individual dice rolls
are compared to a threshold. Any values less than or equal to the threshold are counted
as successes. Spunk is always counted into the threshold, but it may be raised by either
Low Cunning or Dumb Luck, depending on what actions are attempted. Low Cunning
is used on actions involving dirty, rotten tricks where the character takes advantage of
someone else. Dumb Luck is used when the player states two desired outcomes to a
conflict, one that he wants and one that his character wants. In such a roll, the player’s
desired outcome happens if the roll comes up with any successes. The character’s
wishes are fulfilled only if all three dice roll successes (total success). If a conflict
results in total failure for a character (zero successes), the character sustains damage in
the form of a one point loss of Spunk.

### Turn Order

The order of character actions is done
by first rolling the 3d10 for contests,
taking the highest single die roll from
all characters involved, and going in
order from highest to lowest. Thus,
the dice rolls are used for both action
order and conflict resolution.

### Reward System

Every 100 Coins spent (not just
looted) and every 10 enemies slain
earn a player the right to raise his
character’s Low Cunning or Dumb
Luck by one point. Also, players are
Luck by one point. Also, players are
encouraged to “tattle” on the other players when they don’t properly portray their
characters’ Idioms. Whenever this is done, the tattling player gets a bonus on his
character’s next roll.
