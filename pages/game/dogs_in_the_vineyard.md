*Dogs in the Vineyard* was written by Vincent Baker. It is set in the mid-19`<sup>`th`</sup>`-century
American West, in an area similar to pre-statehood Utah, dominated by a religious order
known as “The Faith.” The characters play pioneers who have been charged with the
task of traveling from town to town to make sure their denizens stay true to The Faith’s
teachings. Any citizen falling into sin opens opportunities for the always present threat
of demonic influence and possession. Left unchecked, the acts of a single sinful
individual will lead others into an ever widening spiral of adultery, false doctrine, and
murder which ultimately proves devastating to any affected community. Because of the
dire consequences of failure, the characters are free to use any means to ensure the
purity of the faith, including violence and execution. Their all-important charge earns
the characters the title of “God’s Watchdogs,” or “Dogs” for short.

### Character Makeup

{{ :game:dogs-in-the-vineyard.png}}
Characters have 4 attributes (“Stats”) of “Acuity”, “Body”, “Heart”, and “Will”, which
are not rated as simple numbers but rather in terms of dice (d6s). So, a character might
have Acuity of 4d6, Body of 2d6, Heart of 5d6, and Will
of 6d6. Characters also have traits, which are similarly
of 6d6. Characters also have traits, which are similarly
rated in terms of dice, although d4s, d8s, and d10s are
allowed in addition to d6s on traits. Traits come in three
flavors: action-oriented (“Traits”), relationship-oriented
(“Relationships”), and item oriented (“Belongings”). To
determine how many dice are distributed among
attributes and traits, the player selects a “Background” for
his character from a short list, such as “Well Rounded” or
“Complicated History.” One of a character’s most
important belongings is his Coat, which is adorned with
unique colorful patterns stitched lovingly by relatives and friends. Dog coats are
generally long, duster-style overcoats giving the wearers an Old-West gunslingers look.

### Conflict System

Conflict resolution uses dice pools. Unlike most dice-pool based games, the dice in
Dogs pools are of varying sizes made up of d4s, d6s, d8s, and d10s. When a conflict
starts in Dogs, the players must first determine exactly what is at stake in the conflict.
The number and type of dice that are rolled on each side is determined by the actions
being undertaken, which indicates what attributes and traits are brought into play
according to the game rules. For example, if a character is just talking, he uses Acuity +
Heart. If he is shooting a gun, he uses Acuity + Will, etc. Dice for traits are added
when they are brought into play. So, if a character attacks with his knife having a rating
of 1d6, he adds 1d6 to his dice pool.

After the appropriate dice pools for all parties are gathered, everyone rolls their dice
simultaneously and leaves them on the table so that everyone can view them. The
person initiating the conflict goes first. Both sides then go through a bidding process
similar to that of poker. The initiator goes first with a “Raise,” putting forth two dice
{{ :game:dogs-in-the-vineyard3.png}}
and describing the action
those dice represent. The
sum of the dice equals the
value of the “Raise.” The
opponent then “Sees” with
any number of dice of his
own, stating how his
character responds to the
initial action. The sum of
the “See” dice must equal
or exceed the current
“Raise” value. If this can
be done with a single die,
the opponent has achieved
a “Reversal.” If this is
done with two dice, the
done with two dice, the
opponent “Dodged” the attack with no harm to either side. If the “See” required three
or more dice, the attack successfully lands, inflicting “Fallout Dice” to the defender.

The greater the number of dice needed to “See” the Raise, the greater the number of
“Fallout Dice” sustained. The size of the Fallout Dice is determined by the type of
attack. Verbal attacks deliver d4 damage while gunshots inflict d10 damage, etc.

If a player finds himself losing the conflict, he can escalate it. Thus, a verbal
confrontation between two friends may be escalated by having one or the other pull a
knife. At this point, the person pulling the knife adds the dice associated with the knife
to his dice pool as well as any pertinent attributes, giving him more ammo in the
conflict. His opponent may respond by pulling his gun, adding the pertinent dice to his
own pool as well. At any time, a player can “Give,” meaning he concedes the conflict
to avoid taking further Fallout Dice.

One basic rule of escalating conflicts is that the dice associated with a given attribute or
trait can be added only once to a given conflict. So, while a knife or gun could be used
in more than one action within the conflict, its dice are added only once to the dice pool.

### Turn Order

When it isn’t clear who is opening a conflict or
when there are more than two parties to a conflict,
the order is taken from highest to lowest “Best
Roll.” The Best Roll is simply the sum of the two
highest dice in each pool.

### Reward System

Oddly enough, the Fallout Dice inflicted on a
character can act as a reward. When you roll Fallout Dice after a conflict, if any rolls of
1 come up, something good happens. The player can choose to raise an attribute by a
point, create a new trait of 1d6, alter the die size of an existing trait, etc. Thus, Fallout
Dice are conflicted. Whatever effects are chosen must be justified as a result of the
conflict.
