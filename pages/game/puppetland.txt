John Tynes authored //Puppetland// and Hogshead Publishing distributes it. In this game,
all of the players portray puppets in a world fashioned by the Puppet Maker.
Unfortunately, the puppet Punch murdered the Puppet Maker and thus because the
primary villain of the game. Punch has a number of minions, known as “Punch’s
Boys,” which he fashioned from the flesh of the dead Puppet Maker. Punch also has an
army of nutcracker soldiers. He tyrannically rules most of Puppetland without
compassion or mercy. The game encourages the players to overthrow Punch and, if
possible, restore the kindly Puppet Maker to life.

The world contains a number of fairy tale attractions. First, most puppets live in
Puppettown, which Punch’s castle overlooks. The Lake of Milk and Cookies borders
Puppettown. True to its name, this lake contains eternally yummy milk in which
cookies float like icebergs. Across the lake from Puppettown lies Respite, a small
village founded by Judy, a kindly female marionette who was Punch’s one time lover
but is now his arch enemy. Puppets fleeing Punch’s wrath congregate here.

The game world follows the rules of puppet physics. That is, events take place purely
for dramatic purpose rather than as any kind of attempt to simulate “reality.” There are
no tables, no dice rolls, and no numbers to compare. If one puppet stabs another puppet
with a sword, the second puppet falls to the ground. At the end of each hour-long
session, all puppets in Puppetland wake up safe and snug in their beds fully mended,
even those recently stabbed or otherwise mutilated. The only exception to this rule is
that puppets that have lost all of their “puzzle pieces” do not waken. Puppets start out
with 16 puzzle pieces and lose one whenever injured or if they attempt an action their
description says they cannot do (such as pick something up when they have no hands).
Once lost, puzzle pieces never return.

==== Character Makeup ====

{{ :game:puppetland.png}}
Characters can be Finger Puppets, Hand Puppets, Shadow
Puppets, or Marionette Puppets. The game recommends
having at least one of each type in a group. The various
puppet types have different strengths and weaknesses.
Finger puppets lack hands, so they cannot grab things.
However, their tiny stature makes them quick, so they can
dodge aside when things are thrown at them. Shadow
puppets disappear when they stand sideways due to their
extreme thinness. The big, strong, and slow marionettes
can pick things up and throw them, but cannot dodge. So, each of these puppet types
has specific flaws and gifts categorized under the headings of “This puppet is,” “This
puppet can,” and “This puppet can not.”

After choosing the puppet type, the player must decide on three traits about the puppet
for each of the gift and flaw categories. These can be anything the game master agrees
to and are commonly such things as “very clever,” “do magic tricks,” “can’t tell a lie,”
etc.

==== Conflict System ====
The decision of who wins a
conflict is entirely on the
game master’s shoulders.
He makes choices based on
what he feels is most
dramatically appropriate to
the story. A character’s
flaws and gifts ordinarily
weigh heavily into these
judgments.

==== Turn Order ====
Action order is, once again, based purely on the dramatic effect it has on the storyline
and is decided upon by the game master.

==== Reward System ====
Lacking virtually all mechanics, //Puppetland// essentially has no mechanical reward
system. Its hit point system, involving the puppets’ puzzle pieces, is about the closest
thing that it has. Puppets don’t want to take damage, since it is permanent and always
brings a puppet closer to his “death.” So, avoiding damage is rewarded by virtue of the
fact that the puppet didn’t take any.
