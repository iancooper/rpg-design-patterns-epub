*Nobilis* was written by R. Sean Borgstrom and is published by Hogshead Publishing
Ltd. It is a game in which players portray Nobilis, demi-gods in service to some great
Power, or Imperator. The Imperators continually fight their archenemies, the
Excrucians, godlike beings existing outside of Creation and bent on its destruction.
This never-ending war rages mainly in the spirit realm, but occasionally spills into the
mortal realm. Protecting Earth is the responsibility of the Nobilis. The game is rich
with flavor and sparing in rules. The only time rules come into play is when the
miraculous actions of the god-like characters (player and otherwise) conflict. And, even
then, the system does its best to remain as non-intrusive as possible to enhance the
mood of clashing divinities. Toward this end, the game entirely dispenses with dice and
similar devices. After all, for gods a mere wave of the hand summons grand miracles.
Why should players differ?

### Character Makeup

{{ :game:nobilis.png}}
Characters have four primary attributes ranging in
value from 0 to 5 and are set by spending character
points from a pool. These are “Aspect,” “Domain,”
“Realm,” and “Spirit.” Aspect controls physical,
mental, and social prowess. Domain reflects the
character’s ability to manipulate his “Estate,” which is
the demi-god’s domain of power such as “Forest” or
“Light.” “Realm” indicates how well the character
governs his “Chancel,” a demesne within the confines
of Earth acting as a permanent place of residence. A
high Realm indicates the character can mold and knead physical laws to his will within
the Chancel. Finally, “Spirit” describes how well the character controls magical
powers, including his miraculous defenses against all forms of attack. Characters are
also assigned four pools of “Miracle Points” which are directly tied to the four
attributes. Miracle Points are spent to obtain success in conflicts. Players may also
spend their initial Character Points to raise their permanent “Domain Miracle Points”
value, which determines the number of temporary Domain Miracle Points a character
starts with each gaming session.

Characters also have Restrictions, Virtues, and Affiliations. Restrictions are essentially
minor weaknesses such as “Cannot Kill” or “Honest” that sometimes hamper a
character in his goals. Adopting a restriction gives a player more character points to
spend. Virtues are strengths with their own benefits, such as “Spiritual” or “Artisan.”
The absolute nature of Virtues can land a character in trouble because a character
cannot deny or contradict his Virtue. Affiliations, or “Codes,” are rules and beliefs by
which a character lives.

### Conflict System

Actions that do not deal with miracles are handled in a purely free form fashion. Only
miraculous actions require resolution. All miracles are given a difficulty rating
(“Level”) of 0 to 9 depending on the desired effect. Normally, characters perform
miracles at a rating equal to their pertinent attribute at no cost. However, they can raise
this value by spending Miracle Points from the pool associated with the attribute. When
miracles oppose one another, the higher rated miracle always wins. However, a player
can only spend 1, 2, 4, or 8 Miracle Points at a time. So, if a character has a Domain of
2 and his player wants to perform a miracle requiring a Domain of 5, he must actually
spend 4 points rather than 3. What this means is that the greater the difference between
the character’s attributes and the miracles he wants to perform, the more costly it
becomes. These pools usually refresh at the end of every scene, but that is left to the
discretion of the game master.

### Turn Order

The order in which actions occur is entirely unconstrained in Nobilis. The game master
decides who goes when based on what he feels is dramatically appropriate.

### Reward System

One means of rewarding players is based on how much fun the players had. At the end
of every game session in which all of the players have fun, the game master awards
each player a “Dynasty Point.” At the end of every story in which all players had fun in
most of the sessions, each character gains either a “Character Point” or a “Chancel
Point.” “Fun” is measured simply by asking the players whether they had it. Character
points can be spent to raise the four core attributes of Aspect, Domain, Realm, and
Spirit or can be used to purchase gifts. Dynasty Points can be used in place of any
Miracle Point when the character’s reserve runs dry. They are precious, though, in that
they do not replenish as do Miracle Points. So, they are only used as a form of
emergency backup. Chancel Points are pooled together by members of a Chancel to
buy “Chancel Properties.” This equates to roommates pooling their funds to buy a
better television or stereo.

More interesting rewards
involve the earning or loss of
Miracle Points based on a
character’s “Handicaps,”
which are comprised of
“Limits,” “Affiliations,”
“Restrictions,” and “Virtues,”
A character earns Miracle
Points whenever his
Restrictions or Virtues hinder
him in some significant way
during play. A Limit is a
restriction placed upon a
character’s powers.
Whenever Miracle Points are
normally regenerated (such as
at the beginning of a story), a character’s Limits will earn him more Miracle Points.
When a character performs an action in accordance with his Affiliation’s “Code,” he
earns a Miracle Point. When he defies it, he loses a point. (Affiliations are actually the
primary means of obtaining Miracle Points in the game, and are a very strong incentive
to role-play.) These rewards all have a potent impact on the game because they
encourage players to seek out situations in which their Codes, Restrictions, and Virtues
apply. That way, they can role-play their characters' weaknesses, idiosyncrasies, and
beliefs while racking up the Miracle Points.
