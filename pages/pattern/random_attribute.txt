==== Intent ====
Provide a means to generate attributes values within a game environment through the
use of die rolls or other random means.

==== Also Known As ====
Rolled Attribute, Fortune-Based Gauge, Generated Gauge

==== Related Patterns ====
[[:pattern:Attribute]], [[:pattern:Conflicted Gauge]], [[:pattern:Point Spend Attributes]], [[:pattern:Resource]], [[:pattern:Trait]]

==== Motivation ====
The Random Attribute pattern is a specialization of the Attribute pattern where attribute
values are generated by some random means, usually dice rolls. The purpose of
attributes is sufficiently covered in the Attribute pattern, though, so we won’t go into
the motive of adding attributes to a game. This discussion focuses on the motivations
and concerns of determining attribute values randomly.

This pattern has fallen out of favor in most modern games, although it does tend to crop
up from time to time. (That doesn’t make the pattern inherently inferior to the
alternatives, just out-of-fashion. Its use or avoidance should depend purely on your
design goals.) A game designer might use this pattern if he felt that players needed to
feel that they are “adopting” a character that “already exists” in the game world rather
than having been dreamed up by the player himself. The attribute values are generated
randomly to emphasize the fact that the player has no control over his character’s make
up. Life is random and so is your character.

A game might use random attributes to minimize the number of decisions a player must
make and/or to reduce the number of concepts a player must grasp in creating his
character before play begins. “You have these seven attributes. Don’t worry about
what they mean right now, just roll 4d6 and write down the total for each.”

==== Applicability ====
Use the Random Attribute pattern when you want to provide a fast and easy way to
generate attributes and other gauges for characters with little or no player input.

If you use this pattern, you should be aware of the reasons you have decided to do so.
The means by which gauge values are set has a profound influence on the playability of
any role-playing game. If you are using the pattern merely because you have seen it in
other games and are familiar with it, take some time to familiarize yourself with other
ways to assign gauge values (such as the Point-Spend Attributes pattern). You may find
the alternatives to be more suited to your game and it would be well worth your time to
understand them.

==== Consequences ====
The primary benefits of generating attribute values randomly is to speed character
generation and reduce the amount of knowledge a player must know about his character
before starting play. If your game is designed for “one-shots,” or games which end in
single sessions where players are unlikely to repeatedly play the game, the time needed
to create a character is an important consideration. Most players don’t want to learn a
lot of complex rules without some reasonable expectation of a future payoff. On the
other hand, if the gauges are to have any meaning at all, the players will eventually have
to learn their purpose anyway.

Role-playing games that last many sessions are likely to be harmed by randomly rolled
attributes rather than aided by them. The Random Attribute pattern does a poor job at
gearing a character toward a particular concept. The best the pattern can do is produce
random character stats. Since the entire purpose of any role-playing game is for the
players to have fun, the adoption of any pattern that does a poor job of enabling the fun
to ensue is dubious.

Some games try to gear randomly rolled attributes toward character concepts by first
requiring the players to decide on a character “race” or “class” (see the Class pattern).
The rules for attribute generation are then focused on producing attributes that are
appropriate for that profession. Such systems at least have a better chance of creating
playable characters, but completely destroy any arguments about using the pattern to
“simulate” a character that “already exists.” After all, if a player chooses a character’s
profession using such a system, then he has provided input into his attributes as well.

Some games try to mitigate the Random Attribute pattern’s limitations by allowing
players to randomly generate sets of numbers and then have them assign those values to
whatever attributes they choose. If your primary motivation for using Random
Attributes is to speed character creation, these kinds of modifications
//immediately// lose
the benefits provided by the pattern. In order to decide how attribute values are to be
assigned, a player must understand the meaning of the gauges and must take time to
apportion the values to match his goals. No more time needs to be spent on assigning
gauge values using the Point-Spend Attribute pattern, and the player gains far more
control over his character using that kind of system.

Other games allow players to generate multiple “sets” of attribute values and pick the
best set for his player to use. Again, this wastes a huge amount of time and negates the
primary argument of using the pattern in the first place.

==== Implementation Concerns ====
In using the Random Attribute pattern, you should keep your primary goals in mind
because it is very easy to create rules that compete with the pattern’s main benefits.

Manipulating the attribute values fights against both the “simulation of reality” and
“speed of character generation” goals. So, perhaps the best option is to keep it simple:

  - Decide on what attributes the game is going to use;
  - Select the attributes whose values are going to be randomly generated;
  - Figure out how those attribute values are going to be generated (are they going to be generated differently depending on class or race?);
  - Have players generate the attributes sequentially and take whatever results they get the first time.
  -
 
After a character is initially generated, you may want to allow modification of character
attributes over time to allow for player input as play continues. This can help to
alleviate concerns about players being stuck with unplayable characters. (Once again,
though, if you decide player modifications are necessary, you might be better served
with the [[:pattern:Point-Spend Attributes]] pattern instead.)

==== Samples ====
A game might define attributes of Strength, Health, Dexterity, and Intelligence to all
characters. Attributes could then be assigned by repeatedly rolling 5d6, summing the
dice, and applying the results to each attribute.

==== Known Uses ====
[[:game:Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5]] has 6 primary attributes of Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These are generated by rolling 4d6
six times. In each case, the lowest die is disregard and the remaining 3 are added. The
sums are recorded on a piece of scrap paper. Once they are generated, the player may
assign the numbers to each attribute however he wants. The numbers are then modified
based on the character’s race as chosen by the player. If the generated numbers end up
being too low (based on defined criteria of what “too low” means), the player is allowed
to re-roll his scores. Players are periodically given bonuses to add to their character’s
attributes as they gain levels (see the Level pattern). Point-spend generation is also
standard in many versions, particularly the national tournament level.

[[:game:RIFTS]] has 8 primary attributes of Intelligence Quotient, Mental Endurance, Mental
Affinity, Physical Strength, Physical Prowess, Physical Endurance, Physical Beauty,
and Speed. Each attribute is generated by rolling 3d6 and summing the values. If the
result is a 16, 17, or 18, another d6 is rolled and the result is added to the total.

[[:game:Warhammer Fantasy Role Play]] has 14 “Characteristics” of Movement, Weapons
Skill, Ballistic Skill, Strength, Toughness, Wounds, Initiative, Attacks, Dexterity,
Leadership, Intelligence, Cool, Will Power, and Fellowship. Attributes are generated
randomly using different formulas based on the character’s race, which can be Man, Elf,
Dwarf, or Halfling.
