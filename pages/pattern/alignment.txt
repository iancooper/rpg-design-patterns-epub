==== Intent ====
Differentiate characters by segregating them into different categories that define how
in-game events affect them physically. Characters can also be distinguished by limiting
their abilities based on these same categories.

==== Also Known As ====
Not applicable.

==== Related Patterns ====
[[:pattern:Faction]], [[:pattern:Idiom]]

==== Motivation ====
The goals of Alignment are easy to misconstrue. This is because many games present
alignment as a common characteristic that specifies how a player should portray his
character. Alignments are usually specified with connotive words rather than numbers,
the most common of which are “Good” and “Evil.” To extend the field of aligned
behaviors to a wider range of possibilities, many games specify a number of alignment
characteristics, each of which must be assigned values. In addition to “Good” and
“Evil,” a game might require a player to decide between “Lawful” and “Chaotic” or
“Social” and “Antisocial,” etc.

Because of these moralistic names, it is easy to come to the conclusion that a game
having alignments is actually trying to persuade players to portray their characters in
certain ways. The text might even say this. However, the Alignment pattern does
nothing to promote role-play in any mechanical way (such as by rewarding players for
doing so). Thus, the pattern cannot really be described as a mechanical means of
promoting role-play. (Note that the Faction pattern, which is similar to the Alignment
pattern, //does// provide rewards for role-playing characters according to specified belief
systems. Alignment and Faction are often used together, so it is easy to confuse the
two.)

The Alignment pattern //is// useful, though. One must simply recognize that the actual
design goal which Alignment satisfies has nothing to do with promoting role-play.
Rather, its purpose is to differentiate characters by assigning various physical effects to
some in-game events based on alignment categories. It can also be used to distinguish
characters by constraining character abilities based on their alignment category. A
character’s alignment might therefore limit the character to a subset of a game’s career
choices. For example, a player wishing to play a “White Witch” might be required to
select a Good alignment. Selecting this option might simultaneously preclude the
character from ever becoming a “Black Witch.” A game might even view Good and
Evil as physical properties that can be detected and manipulated. Thus, a “White
Witch” might have specialized skills that have different effects based on the target’s
alignment. She might get a palpable sensation whenever evil approached, for example.
Or, she might be able to summon a “Radiance of Goodness” to aid her Good
companions, hinder her Evil foes, or both.

==== Applicability ====
As a role-playing aid that gives guidance to players concerning the manner in which
they should portray their characters, the Alignment pattern does a poor job. Other
patterns, such as the Faction and Idiom patterns satisfy this goal to a far better degree.
It is highly recommended that you understand these patterns before deciding to use the
Alignment pattern as a role-playing guide.

As a means of differentiating characters based on pre-specified categories, the
Alignment pattern excels. Use the Alignment pattern if your goals include:
  - A desire to define a fixed set of broad categories into which each character is placed.
  - A desire to have in-game effects vary from one character to another based on his assigned category.
  - A desire to limit player options based on the category to which a character is assigned.
Note that goals 1 and 3 can be satisfied by the Class design pattern. If you do not want
to vary the in-game effects of character actions based on a character’s alignment, you
might want to consider that pattern instead.

The Alignment pattern tends to work well with the [[:pattern:Skill]] and [[:pattern:Gift]] patterns, but is less
harmonious with the [[:pattern:Trait]] pattern. The reason is simple. If you want to vary the in-game effects of various actions based on alignment, you need to specify exactly //how//
those effects vary. Pre-defined skills and gifts provide this opportunity in that each
requires its own description. The traits pattern, on the other hand, demands a more
general rule describing how each player-specified trait interacts with the various
alignments. It is telling that none of the games analyzed in researching this book used
both the Trait and Alignment patterns together.

The Alignment pattern mimics the Faction pattern in structure, in that both require
characters to be placed in groups. Consequently, many games combine the Alignment
and Faction patterns. Player options are constrained by a character’s alignment, in-game effects vary based on the alignment, and the alignment serves as a faction
promoting conflict between the different categories.

==== Consequences ====
The Alignment pattern essentially adds a characteristic to each character that interacts
with the game-world reality as if it were a physical property. It can often be detected,
leveraged, and manipulated as in various ways by game rules specifically designed to
do so. Although alignments are often identified by moralistic words such as “Good,”
“Lawful,” “Evil,” “Antisocial,” and the like, they do not provide any mechanical effect
to encourage players to role-play in any particular way (although many players will do
so anyway because they closely associate a character’s alignment with his behavior
patterns).

Since the alignment pattern seeks to vary the effects of actions based on a character’s
alignment category, it can add a large burden to the game-writer’s shoulders. The set of
possible alignments essentially spans the entire game and has far-reaching
consequences. It is likely that a large portion of the skills and gifts contained within a
game’s text will have alignment-based effects. Each of these effects requires its own
discussion to clarify the differences. This means that the various skill and gift
descriptions will be lengthier than if no variable effects existed. You might decide to
lessen your workload by having relatively few skills with alignment-based effects.
However, if you do so, you probably should reconsider using the Alignment pattern.
After all, why complicate your game for something that will only have a minor impact?

==== Implementation Concerns ====
If you decide to use the Alignment pattern, you need to concern yourself with categories
to which you are going to assign characters. The whole “Good” versus “Evil”
alignment concept has been explored by a great many games. So, you may want to
avoid using these alignment categories in your own games to differentiate it from its
predecessors.

Note that a game exploring the dangers and moral dilemmas faced by mountain
climbers might categorize characters as “High Altitude Acclimated,” “Moderate
Altitude Acclimated,” and “Sea-Level Acclimated.” After all, these are broad
categories that limit player options and the specific category would define the effects
that a high-altitude environment would have on a particular character. By spending
sufficient time at a given altitude, a character may gradually change from one category
to another. So, it satisfies the pattern in a way that completely strips out all moralistic
judgment of character behavior.

==== Samples ====
A game with an alignment system might segment alignments into two aspects:
Goodness and Sociability. These would be set as Good or Evil and Social or Antisocial.
Such a system might provide the following definitions:

----
=== Social ===
A Social character befriends others through his trustworthy acts. He helps any
other character in desperate need if possible. Social characters also expect others
to aid them in their needful times.

=== Antisocial ===
An Antisocial character uses other party members to suit his needs. He quickly
picks fights with those standing in his way. Of course, he may act highly social as
long as it serves his needs.

=== Good ===
A Good character has mercy on those who ask and deserve it. He serves justice
and demonstrates kindness to all he meets. Good characters defend townships from
evil invasions. They save fair princesses from evil wizards. A good character
would attempt to slay any slavering, vicious, hungry ogre threatening a nearby
orphanage. Conversely, a Good-aligned character more easily gets help when
needed. Defending a town from an angry ogre endears a character to those
townsfolk saved.

=== Evil ===
An Evil character delights in the misery of others. He strives for personal power
and allows no sense of mercy or justice to interfere with gaining it. Glory,
pleasure, power, and wealth are the major aims of an Evil character but his
methods may seem perfectly innocent on the surface.
----

Such a game might then restrict characters to certain classes (see the [[:pattern:Class]] pattern)
based on their alignments. For example:

----
=== Cult Leader ===
A Cult Leader is the head of a religious sect. Although some cult members may
join the leader on their own volition, most are coerced through brainwashing.
Some cult leaders are actual priests of evil deities while others are just greedy
bastards trying to make a buck. Interestingly enough, a widespread cult may have
many leaders which were “promoted” from the brainwashed cult members. Even
as these cult leaders brainwash others, they fully believe in what they preach.

== Alignment Restrictions ==
To become a Cult Leader, a character must be //Antisocial// and //Evil//.

== Gifts ==
Attracting Followers, Beguiling, Imitating Voices, Inciting Riots, Quoting
Religious Phrases, Sleight of Hand, Throwing Voice

== Skills ==
Brainwashing (+4), Fast Talking (+3), Interrogating (+2), Inspiring Loyalty (+2),
Raising Morale (+2), Manufacturing Hallucinogenic Poisons (+1), Torturing (+1)
----

The game might also include various skills (see the [[:pattern:Skill]] pattern) that have varying
effects based on alignment. For example, it might contain a magical spell such as the
following:

----
=== Shooting Star ===
Alignment Restrictions: The caster must have a Good alignment.\\
Affected Area: One creature\\
Casting Time: 10 seconds\\
Duration: Instantaneous\\
Range: 100 feet

Shooting Star creates the spectacular sight of a sparkling ball shooting toward the
caster’s target. To strike the target, the caster must make an Attack Roll with
Range Weapon Adjustments. The ball is quite harmless to any Good aligned
creature. To Evil creatures, however, it represents wrathful vengeance. Any Evil
creature struck by a Shooting Star sustains 1d8 fire damage per spell level.
----

Note that the text describing the various alignment categories seems to indicate that
characters should be role-played in certain ways. However, the alignments are only
used to identify what career options are available to a character and/or how alignment-
based influences affect him.

==== Known Uses ====
[[:game:Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5]] has an alignment system with two aspects, each of which
can be set to one of three values by the player. The first aspect has the options of
Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic while the second aspect has the possibilities of Good,
Neutral, and Evil. Alignment is used as a prerequisite to attaining certain classes (see
the [[:pattern:Class]] pattern), has skills whose effects vary based on alignment, and serves as a
general role-playing guideline for players.

[[:game:RIFTS]] has three alignment categories of Good, Selfish, and Evil, one of which the
player must choose for his character. In each category there are sub-types. From the
Good category a player may choose Principled or Scrupulous. From the Selfish
category, he may select Unprincipled, or Anarchist. From the Evil category, he has the
options of Miscreant, Aberrant, and Diabolic. The alignment system has no effect on
the game other than to serve as a general guide on what kinds of actions are appropriate
when role-playing a character.

[[:game:Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing]] has 39 different “Personality Traits,” 20 different
“Motivation Traits,” and 12 different “Alignment Traits.” Players roll randomly to
determine which Personality, Motivation, and Alignment characteristics their characters
possess. They then make another roll to determine the extent to which that aspect
applies. For example, one of the “Alignment Traits” is the Good…Evil characteristic.
A percentile roll then determines exactly where on that scale the character lies. Other
than as a general guide for players on how to portray their characters, the alignment
system does not have any apparent impact on the game.

[[:game:Warhammer Fantasy Role Play]] has five alignments, one of which must be chosen for
every character. These are Lawful, Good, Neutral, Evil, and Chaotic. Some career
options are only available to characters with certain alignments. There are no apparent
differences in how various influences affect characters based on alignment, though.
