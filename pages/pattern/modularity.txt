==== Intent ====
Boil each rule down to a single basic concern that it addresses. In other words, separate
each concern into its own separate rule and give each its own unique name.

==== Also Known As ====
Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)

==== Related Patterns ====
[[:pattern:Anonymous Rule]], [[:pattern:Loose Coupling]]

==== Motivation ====
The Modularity design pattern splits different concepts out into separate rules. It is the
antithesis of the Anonymous Rule design pattern. Its goal is to clarify the game’s
overall structure by giving each individual piece its own label. A game designer can
thereby clearly see the components that make up his game. This may give the game
designer insight into useful abstractions combining many disparate rules into fewer
more general ones. In this way, a game can often be simplified and actually //reduce// its
overall rule count. Modularity also frequently shortens the game text by allowing
complex rules containing similar concepts to be broken down into simpler rules that
merely reference common concerns. By splitting out a common issue into its own
separate block, the concern can simply be referenced rather than have its text repeated
in many places. This makes a game easier to modify and maintain, because an
alteration to a concept requires a change in only one place. Finally, modular games are
often easier to understand because the reader does not have to expend much effort in
mentally identifying and separating important concepts into discrete elements. That
work has already been done for him.

==== Applicability ====
The Modularity design pattern applies to any game where reducing overall complexity
is an important concern. If layout and smooth text flow is a higher priority, you may
want to consider the Anonymous Rule design pattern instead.

==== Consequences ====
Perfect modularity can result in an excessive number of individual text blocks unless
careful attention is given to identifying useful abstractions combining similar issues into
fewer more general rules.

==== Implementation Concerns ====
You can go a long way in modularizing your game by using the DRY principle of
software development. Anytime you find yourself repeating something you’ve already
written, split it out under its own heading and give it a name.

==== Samples ====
A game providing descriptions of various monster types might include the following
description:

----
=== Zombie ===
A zombie is a member of the walking dead, a soulless, undead human that has risen
from its grave to shamble aimlessly through the night. Its eyes always gaze
downward with a glassy blank expression. This unconcerned stare is perhaps its
most terrifying aspect, as the monster will rend and tear the flesh of anyone
interfering with its nightly patrol without so much as an upward glance to indicate
an awareness of its victim. Even as a zombie is disemboweled and dismembered,
its stony countenance never wavers.

//Like all undead, zombies are Immune to Mental Spells, are Susceptible to Holy
Water, and have an Aversion to Sunlight.//
----

In this account, the first paragraph is mere description. There is nothing in the text that
affects the mechanics of the game. However, the second paragraph (italicized) is a rule
that would greatly benefit from being split out:

----
=== Zombie ===
A zombie is a member of the walking dead, a soulless, undead human that has risen
from its grave to shamble aimlessly through the night. Its eyes always gaze
downward with a glassy blank expression. This unconcerned stare is perhaps its
most terrifying aspect, as the monster will rend and tear the flesh of anyone
interfering with its nightly patrol without so much as an upward glance to indicate
an awareness of its victim. Even as a zombie is disemboweled and dismembered,
its stony countenance never wavers. Zombies have the standard strengths and
weaknesses possessed by all undead (see **The Perks and Banes of Undeath**).

=== The Perks and Banes of Undeath ===
All members of the living dead are Immune to Mental Spells, are Susceptible to
Holy Water, and have an Aversion to Sunlight.
----

Not only does this technique partition the resistances and vulnerabilities of undeath
from the description of Zombie, it also makes the rule conveniently available for the
description of other undead creatures. If we provide many such descriptions, this
separation will quickly save space and, at the same time, make the game design more
obvious to the reader. Finally, if we later decide to make all undead afraid of holy
symbols, we can easily make this change to all undead by modifying the common rule.

==== Known Uses ====
[[:game:Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5]] has a section in the Dungeon Master’s Guide called the
“Condition Summary.” This section is essentially a list of definitions for various forms
of trauma that can affect a character. Among these are rules of “Blinded,” “Deafened,”
“Dying,” “Exhausted,” “Sickened,” “Stunned,” etc. By separating these out, these
various afflictions can be used throughout the game in a clear, succinct way.

[[:game:Warhammer Fantasy Role Play]] has descriptions of many monsters in their Bestiary.
In these descriptions, monsters have various forms of attack. Rather than endlessly
repeat them for every monster description, the game has categories of various attack
forms. Some of these are “claw,” “kick/stomp,” “gore,” “constriction,” etc. In the
monster descriptions, these words are italicized to indicate that the words have special
meaning. The definitions of the terms are split out into a separate section to which all
monster descriptions refer. By doing this, the definitions can be clearly spelled out
without needless repetition.
