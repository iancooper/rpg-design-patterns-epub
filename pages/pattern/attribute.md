### Motivation

In order to judge the key capabilities of a given player’s character within an imagined
world, games often give characters attributes, or stats. Attributes are specific, named
gauges usually associated with numbers that have a pre-determined meaning within the
game’s rule system (although non-numerical attributes are certainly possible as well).
In many games, the types of attributes are of a pre-determined fixed number, such as
Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, etc. However, this is not always so. Some games
allow attributes to be made up to suit a gaming group’s needs. What is important is that
attributes


*  provide guidelines on how the character can affect the important aspects of the game environment,

*  are defined either by the game itself or by a gaming group before play begins,

*  are the same for all characters of a given type (they may be different for player and non-player characters).

Attributes allow a player to get a handle on the relative impact a Player Character has
on an imagined world works and to what extent he can manipulate the world through
his character.

Systems that provide pre-defined attributes can go into great detail in providing rules to
appropriately handle game situations. This, in turn, allows the game rules to provide an
appropriate level of “crunch,” or mechanical detail, in important game situations.
Attributes also alleviate some of the need to make spot judgment calls that some players
may find unfair.

To focus on the core aspects of a particular genre, some games assign different (but pre-
defined) attributes to different characters, depending on the role a particular character
plays in a story. As long as all characters portraying a specific role are assigned the
same pre-defined aspects, the game could be described as following the Attribute
pattern (although it could be argued that it follows the Class pattern instead).

### Applicability

Use the Attribute Pattern when you want to provide aspects that are common to all
characters where these aspects affect game play in important ways. The majority of
role-playing games use this pattern. Some games lack any common character aspects or
limits. Childhood games such as “Cops and Robbers” and “Cowboys and Indians”
frequently end up with insoluble arguments of “I shot you,” “Na-uh,” “Did so!”…
where the game provides no means to allow the participants to resolve their dispute. If
you are looking for a happy medium between these options, you may want to consider
the Trait pattern instead.

### Consequences

The primary benefit of the Attribute pattern is that it provides a means by which
character interaction with the game world can be gauged, thereby reducing the amount
of time spent in debates over what a character can or cannot accomplish within a
particular game setting. The drawback is that it introduces an artificial mechanism into
play that some people may find intrusive. Such people may prefer pure storytelling or
freeform style games to more structured games incorporating character attributes.

### Implementation Concerns

In using the Attribute pattern, you should consider whether the *number* of attributes
your game assigns each character is going to be pre-determined or variable or some
combination of the two. If you are going to allow a variable aspect to attribute
selection, you need to determine whether you are going to provide a limited list of pre-
determined attributes from which to choose or allow the players complete freedom in
their choices.

Having a fixed number of attributes or a list from which to choose allows you to tailor
those attributes specifically toward game goals and allows you to provide a thorough
description of how each attribute affects play, but limits groups in deciding what
attributes they find important in their own games.

If a list of pre-defined attributes is used, then the options available to a group in
customizing their gaming sessions widen as the list grows. With proper attention to the
writing of each attribute description, such a list can provide a great deal of flexibility in
campaign design without introducing ambiguity. But, the longer the list becomes, the
greater the workload that is placed on the game writers’ shoulders. And, even very long
lists of pre-defined options can seem confining to some players. Keep in mind, though,
that as the game’s designer, it is your job to make sure the game’s rules focus on its
core ideas. What you find important in the game is key, because you understand what
your game is really about. Creating lists of attributes is fine if that supports your vision.
But, if you find yourself creating ever-longer lists of potential attributes you might want
to step back and re-assess your approach.

Having a variable number of unspecified attributes where each group dreams up its own
attribute list allows for even more flexibility. However, this flexibility introduces
difficulties in deciding what exactly each custom attribute really means and how they
interact in conflicts. Such a system must pay particular attention to the descriptions
they provide of what constitutes a valid attribute and how they affect one another in
game play. While this approach may generalize your system to being usable by a wider
audience, it also dilutes your game’s focus and puts a great deal of game design burden
on the players’ shoulders. This may not be a good idea, because game design is hard to
get right. Current thinking in game design is that tightly focused, well-designed games
are more consistently fun than games lacking focus. If your game ends up being a drag
to play, people simply will not play it regardless of how universal its rules.

One way to gain flexibility and yet maintain a focused design is to design your game
around a fixed number of unspecified attributes. That is, set up the mechanics of how
specific character attributes fit into the game system, but leave the actual interpretation
of those attributes open. You could, for example, give each character an “Obsession”
attribute whose mechanical interrelationships with other gauges is fully specified and
yet allow each player to customize its meaning for his character. So, one character
could have an Obsession for cars, which allows that attribute to apply whenever that
character was involved in car scenes. Another might have an Obsession for horses, so
his attribute would apply in scenes dealing with equines.

In a game using the Attribute pattern, you should give some thought to the attributes
that are assigned to non-player characters and objects as well, such as doors, rocks,
griffons, robots, and/or trees. To keep a game as concise as possible, it is reasonable to
put some effort into designing an attribute set that can be used universally throughout
the game environment. That is, play may run more smoothly if all interacting
characters, both player and non-player, use the same collection of stats. Of course, this
is not true for all games. You will have to decide based on your design goals.

### Samples

Comparing the attributes of one character directly to those of another may provide a
yes/no answer directly in your game. For an example of this style of attribute usage,
Bill the Barbarian’s Strength rating is a 5 while Carla the Crusader’s Weight is a 3.
Therefore, Bill can lift Carla because his Strength is greater than her Weight.

In other games, attributes modify die rolls in determining success. As a simple
example, Larry the Lush begs a few dollars from a passing stranger. He hasn’t eaten
since yesterday at noon, but he is standing outside a liquor store. Larry’s Alcoholism
rating is a 3 while his Hunger rating is a 4. Larry’s player rolls two d6. To the result of
one he adds his Alcoholism score and to the other he adds his Hunger rating. The
former sums to a 7 while the latter adds up to a 5. Larry’s addiction gets the best of him
and he stumbles into the shop to buy a bottle of cheap booze in which to drown his
hunger.

### Known Uses

[:game:Fudge](/game/Fudge) allows a Game Master to determine the set of common “attributes” all characters
share in his game world. Words are used to describe attributes as Terrible, Poor,
Mediocre, Fair, Good, Great, and Superb. These are rated according to the “scale” of
the game, where “Fair” is the norm. In a game where the characters are all snails, the
average snail speed would be “Fair.” Similarly, in a game where the characters are
centaurs, the average centaur speed would be “Fair.”

[:game:Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing](/game/Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing) has 10 “stats” of Agility, Constitution, Memory,
Reasoning, Self Discipline, Empathy, Intuition, Presence, Strength, and Quickness.
Players are given a resource pool of 600+10d10 points to distribute among these stats
with certain limitations based on the character’s class. Optionally, a player may
distribute 660 points rather than take his chances on rolling dice. Stat values above 90
become exponentially more expensive.
