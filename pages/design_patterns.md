To raise a “rule of thumb” to the status of design pattern, it must be formalized.
Christopher Alexander stated that a design pattern must contain at least the following
four aspects: a name, a problem statement, a proposed solution, and the consequences of
using the pattern. The “Gang of Four” patterns have even more aspects, which are
meant to further clarify the problem domain and proposed solution. The design pattern
template used in this text mimics the Gang of Four format, with slight modifications
appropriate for role-playing game design.

### Pattern Name

If the pattern has a succinct and commonly known name, use it. Otherwise, make the
name short and descriptive. A good name is crucial, because it becomes the definitive
term used to reference the pattern in future discussions. Because design patterns are
neither “appropriate” or “inappropriate” for a game without first knowing the designer’s
goals, their names should be neutral rather than connote a value judgment.

### Intent

Provide a short statement (one or two sentences at most) describing the rationale for the
pattern’s existence. What does it accomplish? What problem does it solve?

### Also Known As

Give any other common names used for referencing the pattern.

### Related Patterns

Provide references to any similar patterns that should be considered as alternatives
when this pattern is considered.

### Motivation

Provide a detailed description of the problem being addressed by the pattern and its
solution. This description may be as lengthy as necessary to describe the problem being
addressed.

### Example Structure (Optional)

Provide a diagram of the participants in the pattern. Most of the diagrams in this book
are gauge diagrams. The diagrams abstract away details to expose the underlying
structure.

### Applicability

Provide a list of criteria of when to use the pattern. When can it be applied? What
kinds of poor designs does the pattern address? What are the alternatives?

### Consequences

Provide descriptions of the consequences of using the pattern, both good and bad.

### Implementation Concerns

Provide descriptions of what practical design issues should be considered when
applying the pattern.

### Samples

Provide examples of using the pattern. Keep the examples as simple as possible to
illustrate only the key points.

### Known Uses

Reference games using the pattern and explain how they use it. This need not be an
exhaustive list of all known instances of use, but rather a sampling of uses that covers
the broadest possible spectrum of current application. There should be at least 2
examples in this section to ensure that the pattern is, in fact, a pattern and not just a
single-use idea (however brilliant).
