# Design Patterns of Successful Role-Playing Games (ePUB version)

This is a project to convert the Design Patterns of Successful Role-Playing
Games book into ePUB format so I can read it into my ebook reader anywhere.

I'm using the Felix Ple≈üoianu's wiki work as a base for this work as it ease
many things for me.

I'll add a git tag (and remove this comment) once I feel the ePUB is ready to
rock.

## TODO items

These are TODO items that I could use some help:

- [ ] [`identifier` metadata section](http://pandoc.org/README#epub-metadata). I
  don't believe there is a ISBN/DOI for this book, but I believe we can use an
  `URN` identifier.
